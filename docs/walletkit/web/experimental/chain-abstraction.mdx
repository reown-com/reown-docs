# Chain Abstraction

:::note
ðŸ’¡ Chain Abstraction is currently in experimental phase. 
:::

Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.


## How It Works

:::note
Apps need to pass `gas` as null when sending a transaction to allow proper gas estimation by the wallet. Refer to this [guide](../../../appkit/next/experimental/chain-abstraction.mdx) for more details.
:::

When sending a transaction, you need to:
1. Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2. If not, use the `prepareDetailed` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3. Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4. Use `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

## Methods

:::note
Make sure you are using canary version of `@reown/walletkit`.
:::

Following are the methods from WalletKit that you will use in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare 

This method checks if a transaction requires additional bridging transactions beforehand.

```typescript
public abstract prepareDetailed(params: {
  transaction: ChainAbstractionTypes.PartialTransaction;
}): ChainAbstractionTypes.PrepareDetailedResponse;
```

### Execute 

Helper method used to broadcast the bridging and initial transactions and wait for them to be completed.

```typescript
public abstract execute(params: {
  orchestrationId: ChainAbstractionTypes.OrchestrationId;
  bridgeSignedTransactions: ChainAbstractionTypes.SignedTransaction[];
  initialSignedTransaction: ChainAbstractionTypes.SignedTransaction;
}): ChainAbstractionTypes.ExecuteResult;
```

### Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepareDetailed` method. 
If it is needed, you must sign all the fulfillment transactions and use the `execute` method. 
Here's a complete example:

```typescript
// Check if chain abstraction is needed
const result = await walletKit.chainAbstraction.prepareDetailed({
  transaction: {
    from: transaction.from as `0x${string}`,
    to: transaction.to as `0x${string}`,
    // @ts-ignore - cater for both input or data
    input: transaction.input || (transaction.data as `0x${string}`),
    chainId: chainId,
  },
});

// Handle the prepare result
if ('success' in result) {
  if ('notRequired' in result.success) {
    // No bridging required, proceed with normal transaction
    console.log('no routing required');
  } else if ('available' in result.success) {
    const available = result.success.available;
    
    // Sign all bridge transactions and initial transaction
    const bridgeTxs = available.route.map(tx => tx.transactionHashToSign);
    const signedBridgeTxs = bridgeTxs.map(tx => wallet.signAny(tx));
    const signedInitialTx = wallet.signAny(available.initial.transactionHashToSign);

    // Execute the chain abstraction
    const result = await walletKit.chainAbstraction.execute({
      bridgeSignedTransactions: signedBridgeTxs,
      initialSignedTransaction: signedInitialTx,
      orchestrationId: available.routeResponse.orchestrationId,
    });
  }
}
```

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/web-examples/tree/main/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2) built with React. 

## Testing 

To test Chain Abstraction, you can use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending [USDC/USDT](../../../walletkit/features/experimental/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction supported wallet. 
You can also use this [sample wallet](https://react-wallet.walletconnect.com) for testing.
