# Installation

Add the `jitpack.io` Maven repository to your `root/build.gradle.kts` file. For example:

```gradle
allprojects {
 repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

In `app/build.gradle.kts` add the WalletKit package and its dependencies:

```gradle
implementation("com.reown:android-core:release_version")
implementation("com.reown:walletkit:release_version")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed WalletKit, you're ready to start integrating it. The next section will walk you through the process of setting up your project to use the SDK.
