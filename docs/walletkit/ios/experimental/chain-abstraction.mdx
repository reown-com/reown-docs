# Chain Abstraction

Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

## How It Works

:::note
Apps need to pass `gas` as null, while sending a transaction to allow proper gas estimation by the wallet. Refer to this [guide](../../../appkit/next/experimental/chain-abstraction.mdx) for more details.
:::

When sending a transaction, you need to:
1. Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2. If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3. Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4. Invoke `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

## Methods

Following are the methods from WalletKit that you will use in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare 

This method is used to check if chain abstraction is needed. If it is, it will return a response with the necessary transactions and it's hashes to be signed. 
If it is not, it will return a response with the original transaction. 

```swift
@available(*, message: "This method is experimental. Use with caution.")
public func prepare(chainId: String, from: FfiAddress, call: Call, localCurrency: Currency) async throws -> PrepareDetailedResponse {
}

This method is used to execute the fulfillment operations, including transactions broadcasting.
```swift
@available(*, message: "This method is experimental. Use with caution.")
public func execute(uiFields: UiFields, routeTxnSigs: [FfiPrimitiveSignature], initialTxnSig: FfiPrimitiveSignature) async throws -> ExecuteDetails 
```

## Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. If it is needed, you must sign all the fulfillment transactions hashes and invoke the `execute` method.  

If the operation is not successful, you need to send a JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user. 

```swift
let routeResponseSuccess = try await WalletKit.instance.ChainAbstraction.prepare(
    chainId: selectedNetwork.chainId.absoluteString,
    from: myAccount.address,
    call: call,
    localCurrency: .usd
)

switch routeResponseSuccess {
case .success(let routeResponse):
    switch routeResponse {
    case .available(let UiFileds):
        // If the route is available, present a CA transaction flow
        for txnDetails in uiFields.route {
            let hash = txnDetails.transactionHashToSign
            let sig = try! signer.signHash(hash)
            routeTxnSigs.append(sig)
        }
        
        // sign initial transaction hash
        let initialTxHash = uiFields.initial.transactionHashToSign
        let initialTxnSig = try! signer.signHash(initialTxHash)      
        
        let executeDetails = try await WalletKit.instance.ChainAbstraction.execute(uiFields: uiFields, routeTxnSigs: routeTxnSigs, initialTxnSig: initialTxnSig)
        
    case .notRequired:
        // user does not need to move funds from other chains, sign and broadcast original transaction
        
    }
case .error(let routeResponseError):
    // Show an error
    
}

```

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Example/WalletApp/PresentationLayer/Wallet/CATransactionModal/CATransactionPresenter.swift) with Swift. 

## Testing 

Best way to test Chain Abstraction is to use [sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)

You can also use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending USDC with any chain abstraction-supported wallet.
