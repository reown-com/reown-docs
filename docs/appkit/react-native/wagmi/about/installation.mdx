```
yarn add @reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native wagmi viem @tanstack/react-query
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, and SVG's.

```
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-svg react-native-modal @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

On iOS, use CocoaPods to add the native modules to your project:

```
npx pod-install
```
