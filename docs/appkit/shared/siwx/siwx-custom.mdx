Alternatively from the [Default Implementation](./siwx-default), you can create your own implementation of the **SIWX** feature to suit your specific requirements.

**SIWX** is developed to work as a plugin system for AppKit and to enable correctly it you need to fulfill the expected interface within the `createAppKit` function.

## SIWXConfig interface

This is the interface that you need to implement to create your own **SIWX** feature.

```ts
interface SIWXConfig {
  createMessage: (input: SIWXMessage.Input) => Promise<SIWXMessage>
  addSession: (session: SIWXSession) => Promise<void>
  revokeSession: (chainId: CaipNetworkId, address: string) => Promise<void>
  setSessions: (sessions: SIWXSession[]) => Promise<void>
  getSessions: (chainId: CaipNetworkId, address: string) => Promise<SIWXSession[]>
}
```

All the typings used are exposed by `@reown/appkit-core` package. You may check the source code [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/SIWXUtil.ts).

## Constraints

You are able to implement the `SIWXConfig` in the way you would like, but some constraints MUST be followed to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly and it will work as expected:

### `createMessage`

This method will be called to create a new message to be signed by the user.

- The message MUST be unique and contain all the necessary information to verify the user's identity.

### `addSession`

This method will be called to store a new single session.

- This method MUST verify if the session is valid and store it in the storage successfully.

### `revokeSession`

This method will be called to revoke all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

- This method MUST delete all the sessions stored for the specific chain and address successfully.

### `setSessions`

This method will be called to replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones.

- This method MUST verify all the sessions before storing them in the storage;
- This method MUST replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones successfully otherwise it MUST throw an error.

### `getSessions`

This method will be called to get all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

- This method MUST return only sessions that are verified and valid;
- This method MUST NOT return expired sessions.

## Example

Here is an example of how you can implement use your `SWIXConfig` interface:

```ts
import { createAppKit, type SIWXConfig } from '@reown/appkit'

const siwx: SIWXConfig = {
  createMessage: async (input) => {
    // Implement your logic to create a message
    return 'my message'
  }
  addSession: async (session) => {
    // Implement your logic to add a session
  },
  revokeSession: async (chainId, address) => {
    // Implement your logic to revoke a session
  },
  setSessions: async (sessions) => {
    // Implement your logic to set sessions
  },
  getSessions: async (chainId, address) => {
    // Implement your logic to get sessions
    return []
  }
}

createAppKit({
  // ... your configuration
  siwx
})
