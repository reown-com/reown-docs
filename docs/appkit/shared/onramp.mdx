title: On-Ramp
---

AppKit seamlessly incorporates Coinbase Pay, enabling users to sign in to their Coinbase accounts and utilize fiat payment methods for purchasing cryptocurrencies.

:::info Note
On-Ramp is supported in the latest version of AppKit. If you are using an older version, make sure you upgrade.
:::

## Integration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required. 

If you prefer to disable it, set the `onramp` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createAppKit` function.

:::info Note
On-Ramp is now available on **Solana**. The configuration for On-Ramp on both EVM and Solana is the same. Please refer to the code snippet below.
:::

```ts
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  caipNetworks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata: metadata,
  features{
    /* highlight-add-start */
    onramp: false // Optional - true by default
    /* highlight-add-end */
  }
})
```
