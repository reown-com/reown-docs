```csharp
await AppKit.InitializeAsync(
    new AppKitConfig(
        projectId: "YOUR PROJECT ID",
        new Metadata(
            name: "My Game",
            description: "Short description
            url: "https://example.com",
            iconUrl: "https://example.com/logo.png"
        )
    )
);
```

- **description**: The project description is a human-readable description for your project.
- **url**: The project URL

}
```

3. Open the modal
