# How to Sign Messages, Send Transactions, and Get Balance in EVM using AppKit with Wagmi

Learn how to use Reown AppKit for essential wallet functionalities such as signing messages, sending transactions, and retrieving wallet balances.

---

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Retrieve the balance of the connected wallet. 
- Sign a message using a connected wallet.
- Send a transaction to the EVM blockchain.


This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s dive in!

## AppKit Minimal Installation

You can start a small project following the guidelines from our [installation React docs using Wagmi](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation?platform=wagmi)

## Start building

In this guide we are going to use the library [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to make the calls to the blockchain and to interact with the wallet.

### Get Balance

Fetching a user's balance is straightforward using the `useBalance` hook from wagmi.

1. Start by importing the useBalance hook, the AppKit hook to get the account information and the Address type.
```jsx
import { useBalance } from 'wagmi'
import { useAppKitAccount } from '@reown/appkit/react'
import { type Address } from 'viem'
```

2. Use the `useAppKitAccount` hook to retrieve the user's address and check if they are connected. Also call the `useBalance` hook.

```jsx
// AppKit hook to get the address and check if the user is connected
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount() 

// Call the useBalance hook with the user's address to prepare for fetching the balance.
const { refetch } = useBalance({
    address: address as Address
}); 

```

3. Create a function to fetch and display (in console) the balance when triggered

```jsx
// function to get the balance
const handleGetBalance = async () => {
    const balance = await refetch();
    console.log(`${balance?.data?.value.toString()} ${balance?.data?.symbol.toString()}`);
}

```

4. Finally, in order to call the function you can show the button in a component when `isConnected` is `true`

```jsx
return (
    isConnected && (
    <div >
        <button onClick={getBalance}>Get Balance</button>  
    </div>
    )
  )
```

### Sign a message

In order to raise the modal to sign a message with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing the `useSignMessage` hook.

```jsx
import { useSignMessage } from 'wagmi'
```

2. Extract the `signMessageAsync` function from the `useSignMessage` hook. This function allows you to prompt the connected wallet to sign a specific message. Also get the address and isConnected as explain before.
```jsx
// Wagmi hook to sign a message
const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage() 

// AppKit hook to get the address and check if the user is connected
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount() 
```

3. Generate the function to raise the modal to sign the message

```jsx
// function to sing a msg 
const handleSignMsg = async () => {
    // message to sign
    const msg = "Hello Reown AppKit!" 
    const sig = await signMessageAsync({ message: msg, account: address as Address }); 
}
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
    isConnected && (
    <div >
        <button onClick={handleSignMsg}>Sign Message</button>  
    </div>
    )
  )
```

### Send a transaction in EVM

In order to raise the modal to sign and send a transaction with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing `useEstimateGas` and `useSendTransaction` hooks.

```jsx
import { useEstimateGas, useSendTransaction } from 'wagmi'
import { parseGwei, type Address } from 'viem'
```

2. Use the `useEstimateGas` hook to calculate the gas required for the transaction, then proceed to send the transaction and get the user's connection status with the provided hooks.
```jsx

// test transaction
const TEST_TX = {
  to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045" as Address, // vitalik address
  value: parseGwei('0.0001')
}

 // Wagmi hook to estimate gas
const { data: gas } = useEstimateGas({...TEST_TX});

// Wagmi hook to send a transaction
const { data: hash, sendTransaction, } = useSendTransaction(); 

// AppKit hook to check if the user is connected
const { isConnected } = useAppKitAccount() 
```

3. Generate the function to raise the modal to send the transaction

```jsx
// function to send a TX
const handleSendTx = () => {
    try {
    sendTransaction({
        ...TEST_TX,
        gas // Add the gas to the transaction
    });
    } catch (err) {
        console.log('Error sending transaction:', err);
    }
}
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
    isConnected && (
    <div >
        <button onClick={handleSendTx}>Send Transaction</button>  
    </div>
    )
  )
```
