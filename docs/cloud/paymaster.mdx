## Accessing Reown Paymaster

1. Log in to your Cloud Account [here](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in).
2. Click on your Project, then select the "Paymaster" Tab.

## Creating a Policy
Click on "Add Policy" and follow the steps within the policy creation screen.

### 1. Select a Plan

#### Free Plan

If you select the free plan, you will have *unlimited* access to sponsoring on testnets. Currently, only Sepolia is supported.

#### Pay-as-you-go

With the Pay-as-you-go plan, you will be asked to enter credit card information. *You will not be billed immediately*.

Instead you will be charged based on usage, with Paymaster Credits. This is
calculated using a simple formula: 
  * amount of gas sponsored + fee

Billing occurs monthly; however, if a threshold of 100 USD is reached, an immediate charge will occur, and the billing cycle will reset.

### 2. Add Policy Basic Info 

1. Write a descriptive name for your policy
2. Add a start date for your policy. The current date and time are selected by default. However, you can set a future date and time to align your policy's start with a campaign or similar event.
3. Optionally, add an end date, and your policy will automatically lapse on that date.

### 3. Select Chains

All supported chains are enabled by default, but you can deselect any chain to sponsor transactions only on specific chains.

#### Currently Supported Mainnet Chains
- Ethereum
- Polygon 
- Avalanche
- Mantle 
- Celo 
- Optimism 
- Base 
- Zora 
- Gnosis 
- Metis

#### Currently Supported Testnet Chains 
- Sepolia

### 4. Add Policy Logic

Policy logic can be updated in one of two ways:
1. JSON editor
2. No-code builder (coming soon)

There are distinct advantages to this:
1. You can maintain an auditable history of your policies by storing the JSON files for each policy.
2. You can auto-generate policies for your campaigns, as it’s a straightforward JSON schema.
3. Policies are highly flexible, allowing you to chain conditional checks to target specific smart contracts, particular methods within a contract, expected gas limits, and more.

Once created, the policy will become active immediately if the start date has already passed, making it ready for use.

## Sponsoring transactions

Based on [EIP 5792](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5792.md) and [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md), utilizing a paymaster is as simple as providing the paymaster RPC URL.

The Paymaster screen includes an `RPC URL` selector for chain-specific URLs. All URLs follow the same format, varying only by chain ID, so you can generate the URL in your dApp based on the active chain.

### Policy Selection

By default, all policies will be validated in succession until one returns true.

There is the option of passing `policyId` in the optional to the RPC.
However, please note that as Dapp can not send this policyId directly, as that
is within the control of the Wallets since they make the call to the Paymaster's
RPC per [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md).

```



## JSON Schema: A Practical Example Walkthrough

### Basics
The schema itself is a simple object representation of the following
> Is some key from a user operation equivelant to _(or some other comparision)_  some value?

This is defined in `params` as such:
```json
{
  "key": "some_key",
  "op": "equals",
  "value": "some_value"
}
```

### Chaining Conditionals

The flexibility here lies in the ability to chain different conditionals together. For example, you can check if the User Op targets a specific smart contract and a particular function within that contract's ABI. Since these fields are encoded within a UserOp’s `callData`, two different methods are needed to access this information:
1. `callDataMethodEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific function
2. `callDataToEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific contract

Essentially, we want to combine the following two conditions:

```json
{
  "key": "callData",
  "op": "callDataToEquals",
  "value": "0xa123cd918..."
}
```

```json
{
  "key": "callData",
  "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
  "value": "methodFoo"
}
```

To do this, we need to zoom out and see how to set the `params`:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The new field we introduced here is `ands`. The way the schema is designed, Each `params` object, can be 
accompanied with an `ands` OR an `ors` field which is an array of more params that will require that they 
either all pass as true, or only one of them is true, respectively.

A `params` object can not have both an `ors` and
an `ands` simultanousely. However, its "children" (the params in an `ands` or `ors`) can have different conditonals than their parent.

For example, to make it so that the above policy also passes for `methodBar` and `methodBaz`, it can be ammended as follows:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
      "ors": [
        {
          "params": {
            "key": "callData",
            "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
            "value": "methodBar"
          }
        },
        {
          "params": {
            "key": "callData",
            "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
            "value": "methodBaz"
          }
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This essentially is a schema translation of
> The UserOp should target smart contract 0xa123.. and either use the methods `methodFoo` or `methodBar` or `methodBaz`.

Note that at the top it used `ands` and then used `ors` for the children. This is fully legal within the schema.

However, the <span style={{color: 'red'}}>following is incorrect </span>:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

***In this case, the `ors` will be completely ignored. If both `ors` and `ands` are present, then the `ands` will take presedence.***

### ABI Parsing

For the policy to actually know how to read the `callData` it needs to know the smart contract's ABI. 

For this we introduce 2 new fields. `policyStaticProps` and `metadata`. Both are essentially free range key-value 
dictionaries used to store information within the policy to be accessed later. The key thing to note is that
values within `policyStaticProps` can be accessed from within `metadata`. This becomes invaluable with policies
that have multiple conditonals like the one above.

```json
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  }
  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
    "value": "methodBaz"
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
    }
  }
```

Essentially here, `contractAbi` is a variable that `callDataMethodEquals` requires. To supplement its value, we use `<contract1.abi>`.
What `<contract1.abi>` means is essentially `policyStaticProps.contract1.abi`. The `<>` indicate that this value is coming from `policyStaticProps`.

Note that the values within `policyStaticProps` can be named anything. The only constraint is that `contractAbi` is named the same within the metadata 
as that is what `callDataMethodEquals` will look for.

Extrapolating this to our running example above, the complete policy becomes:
```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control", /* currently the only one supported */
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  }

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

### Housekeeping
The final bit to making a valid policy is adding `metadata` to the root of your policy, to keep basic metadata like what chains to support, the startTime and endTime.
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "chainIds": [
      1,        // Etheruem
      137,      // Polygon
      11155111  // Sepolia (Testnet)
    ],
    "startTime": "2024-10-23T15:50:00.000Z",
    "endTime": null
  }
}
```

Adding this to the above gives us a complete and working policy.

### Complete Example Policy
The following is the culmination of all the above steps to create a complete policy.

In English, what this policy is saying is 
> The policy starts on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October 2024, does not expire and will support Ethereum, Polygon and Testnet. 
> For a UserOp to pass this policy, it needs to be targeting smart contract `0xa123cd918...` **and** it has to be using
> One of the following methods from the contract: `methodFoo` **or** `methodBar` **or** `methodBaz`.

```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control", /* currently the only one supported */
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "chainIds": [
        1,        // Etheruem
        137,      // Polygon
        11155111  // Sepolia (Testnet)
      ],
      "startTime": "2024-10-23T15:50:00.000Z",
      "endTime": null
    }
  },
  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```
