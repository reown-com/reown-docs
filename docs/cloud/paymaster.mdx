title: Paymaster
---

:::warning
  Paymaster feature is still currently in a limited access phase and only
  available by invite. If you're interested in access, please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).
:::

## Accessing Reown Paymaster

1. Log in to your Cloud Account [here](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in).
2. Click on your Project, then select the "Paymaster" Tab.

## Creating a Policy
Click on "Add Policy" and follow the steps within the policy creation screen.

### 1. Select a Plan

#### <span style={{fontSize: "1.25em"}}>Free Plan</span>

If you select the free plan, you will have *unlimited* access to sponsoring on testnets. Currently, only Sepolia is supported.

#### <span style={{fontSize: "1.25em"}}>Pay-As-You-Go</span>

With the Pay-as-you-go plan, you will be asked to enter credit card information. *You will not be billed immediately*.

Instead you will be charged based on usage, with Paymaster Credits. This is
calculated using a simple formula: 
  * amount of gas sponsored + fee


:::info
Billing occurs monthly; however, <ins>if a threshold of 100 USD is reached, an
immediate charge will occur</ins>, and the billing cycle will reset.
:::

### 2. Add Policy Basic Info 

1. Write a descriptive name for your policy
2. Add a start date for your policy. The current date and time are selected by default. However, you can set a future date and time to align your policy's start with a campaign or similar event.
3. Optionally, add an end date, and your policy will automatically lapse on that date.

### 3. Select Chains

All supported chains are enabled by default, but you can deselect any chain to sponsor transactions only on specific chains.

#### Currently Supported Mainnet Chains
- Ethereum
- Polygon 
- Avalanche
- Mantle 
- Celo 
- Optimism 
- Base 
- Zora 
- Gnosis 
- Metis

#### Currently Supported Testnet Chains 
- Sepolia

### 4. Add Policy Logic

Policy logic can be updated in one of two ways:
1. JSON editor
2. No-code builder (In development, coming soon)

There are distinct advantages to this:
1. You can maintain an auditable history of your policies by storing the JSON files for each policy.
2. You can auto-generate policies for your campaigns, as it’s a straightforward JSON schema.
3. Policies are highly flexible, allowing you to chain conditional checks to target specific smart contracts, particular methods within a contract, expected gas limits, and more.

Once created, the policy will become active immediately if the start date has already passed, making it ready for use.

## Sponsoring transactions

Based on [EIP 5792](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5792.md) and [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md), utilizing a paymaster is as simple as providing the paymaster RPC URL.

The Paymaster screen includes an `RPC URL` selector for chain-specific URLs. All
URLs follow the same format, varying only by chain ID, so you can generate the
URL in your Dapp based on the active chain.

### Policy Selection

By default, all policies will be validated in succession until one returns true.

There is the option of passing `policyId` in the optional to the RPC. This can 
be sent by the dapp via the the `context` field per [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md). 
However - please note that different paymasters may accept `policyId` with a
different key or format. For Reown's Paymaster, that key is `policyId`.

```sh
curl --location <YOUR_PAYMASTER_URL> \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"method":"pm_getPaymasterData","params":[{
      "sender": "0xb56e8f33dc5d32be80c32b8eb97081fa272488bb",

      "policyId": "298191-ff1719-5a9c-abb4-40911aa123"
    }],"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id": 1}'
```



## JSON Schema: A Practical Example Walkthrough

### Basics
The schema itself is a simple object representation of the following
> Is some key from a user operation equivalent to _(or some other comparison)_  some value?

This is defined in `params` as such:
```json
{
  "key": "some_key",
  "op": "equals",
  "value": "some_value"
}
```

### Chaining Conditionals

The flexibility here lies in the ability to chain different conditionals together. For example, you can check if the User Op targets a specific smart contract and a particular function within that contract's ABI. Since these fields are encoded within a UserOp’s `callData`, two different methods are needed to access this information:
1. `callDataMethodEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific function
2. `callDataToEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific contract

Essentially, we want to combine the following two conditions:

```json
{
  "key": "callData",
  "op": "callDataToEquals",
  "value": "0xa123cd918..."
}
```

```json
{
  "key": "callData",
  "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
  "value": "methodFoo"
}
```

To do this, we need to zoom out and see how to set the `params`:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The new field we introduced here is `ands`. The way the schema is designed, Each `params` object, can be 
accompanied with an `ands` OR an `ors` field which is an array of more params that will require that they 
either all pass as true, or only one of them is true, respectively.

A `params` object can not have both an `ors` and
an `ands` simultaneously. However, its "children" (the params in an `ands` or `ors`) can have different conditionals than their parent.

For example, to make it so that the above policy also passes for `methodBar` and `methodBaz`, it can be amended as follows:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
      "ors": [
        {
          "params": {
            "key": "callData",
            "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
            "value": "methodBar"
          }
        },
        {
          "params": {
            "key": "callData",
            "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
            "value": "methodBaz"
          }
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This essentially is a schema translation of
> The UserOp should target smart contract 0xa123.. and either use the methods `methodFoo` or `methodBar` or `methodBaz`.

Note that at the top it used `ands` and then used `ors` for the children. This is fully legal within the schema.

However, the <span style={{color: 'red'}}>following is incorrect </span>:

```json
{
  // Rest of policy..

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

***In this case, the `ors` will be completely ignored. If both `ors` and `ands` are present, then the `ands` will take precedence.***

### ABI Parsing

For the policy to actually know how to read the `callData` it needs to know the smart contract's ABI. 

For this we introduce 2 new fields. `policyStaticProps` and `metadata`. Both are essentially free range key-value 
dictionaries used to store information within the policy to be accessed later. The key thing to note is that
values within `policyStaticProps` can be accessed from within `metadata`. This becomes invaluable with policies
that have multiple conditionals like the one above.

```json
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  }
  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
    "value": "methodBaz"
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
    }
  }
```

Essentially here, `contractAbi` is a variable that `callDataMethodEquals` requires. To supplement its value, we use `<contract1.abi>`.
What `<contract1.abi>` means is essentially `policyStaticProps.contract1.abi`. The `<>` indicate that this value is coming from `policyStaticProps`.

Note that the values within `policyStaticProps` can be named anything. The only constraint is that `contractAbi` is named the same within the metadata 
as that is what `callDataMethodEquals` will look for.

Extrapolating this to our running example above, the complete policy becomes:
```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control", /* currently the only one supported */
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  }

  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

### Housekeeping
The final bit to making a valid policy is adding `metadata` to the root of your policy, to keep basic metadata like what chains to support, the startTime and endTime.
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "chainIds": [
      1,        // Etheruem
      137,      // Polygon
      11155111  // Sepolia (Testnet)
    ],
    "startTime": "2024-10-23T15:50:00.000Z",
    "endTime": null
  }
}
```

:::info 
<ins>These only need to be manually set when communicating with the API</ins>. 

By design, certain elements of the JSON policy are not editable in the UI. Those
being: `startTime`, `endTime` and `chainIds`. This is because they are edited in
the previous UI panels.
:::

Adding this to the above gives us a complete and working policy.

### Complete Example Policy
The following is the culmination of all the above steps to create a complete policy.

In English, what this policy is saying is 
> The policy starts on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October 2024, does not expire and will support Ethereum, Polygon and Testnet. 
> For a UserOp to pass this policy, it needs to be targeting smart contract `0xa123cd918...` **and** it has to be using
> One of the following methods from the contract: `methodFoo` **or** `methodBar` **or** `methodBaz`.

```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control", /* currently the only one supported */
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [...Contract ABI goes here]
    }
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "chainIds": [
        1,        // Etheruem
        137,      // Polygon
        11155111  // Sepolia (Testnet)
      ],
      "startTime": "2024-10-23T15:50:00.000Z",
      "endTime": null
    }
  },
  "params": {
    "key": "callData",
    "op": "callDataToEquals",
    "value": "0xa123cd918..."
  },
  "ands": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodFoo"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "ors": [
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        "key": "callData",
        "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
        "value": "methodBaz"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```
