Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

## How It Works

<Info>
Apps need to pass `gas` as null, while sending a transaction to allow proper gas estimation by the wallet. Refer to this [guide](../../../../appkit/next/early-access/chain-abstraction) for more details.

When sending a transaction, you need to:
1. Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2. If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3. Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4. Use `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation
