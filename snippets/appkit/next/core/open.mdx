// to connect and show only bitcoin wallets
open({ view: "Connect", namespace: "bip122" });

// to connect and show only ethereum wallets
open({ view: "Connect", namespace: "eip155" });

  view: 'Swap',
  arguments: {
    amount: '321.123',
    fromToken: 'USDC',
    toToken: 'ETH'
  }
})

// to open wallet send interface
