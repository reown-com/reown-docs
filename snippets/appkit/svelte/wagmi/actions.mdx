You can use [Wagmi actions](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/actions/readContract) to interact with wallets and smart contracts:

```ts
import { readContract } from '@wagmi/core'
import { USDTAbi } from '../abi/USDTAbi'

const USDTAddress = '0x...'

const data = readContract(wagmiConfig, {
  address: USDTAddress,
  abi: USDTAbi,
  functionName: 'totalSupply',
  args: []
})
```
