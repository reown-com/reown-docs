title: On-Ramp
---

Reown seamlessly incorporates Coinbase Pay, enabling users to sign in to their Coinbase accounts and utilize fiat payment methods for purchasing cryptocurrencies.

<Note>
On-Ramp is supported in the latest version of Reown AppKit. If you are using an older version, make sure you upgrade.
</Note>

## Integration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required. 

If you prefer to disable it, set the `onramp` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createAppKit` function.

<Note>
On-Ramp is now available on **Solana**. The configuration for On-Ramp on both EVM and Solana is the same. Please refer to the code snippet below.
</Note>

```ts {7}
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata: metadata,
  features: {
    onramp: false // Optional - true by default
  }
})
```
