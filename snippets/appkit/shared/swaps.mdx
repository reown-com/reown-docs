The Swap feature allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the AppKit modal.
This feature is designed to provide a seamless and efficient swapping experience, leveraging our collaboration with [1inch](https://1inch.io/) as the swap provider.

## Availability

- **Requirement**: The Swap feature is available only to users who log in via email or social login. This is consistent with other wallet features such as sending tokens.
- **Transaction Fee**: Reown charges a 0.85% transaction fee on all swaps.
- **Supported Tokens**: The tokens available for swapping are limited to those supported by 1Inch. Note that the availability of tokens may vary depending on the network.
- **Network Availability**: The Swap feature is not available on Sepolia or other testnets at this time.

## How to Use

1. **Connect**: Ensure you are logged in via email or social login.
2. **Access Swap**: Navigate to the Swap feature within the account view.
3. **Select Tokens**: Choose the tokens you wish to swap from the available options.
4. **Type amount**: Enter your desired swap values. You can use the Max button to swap your all tokens or enter any specific number.
5. **See swap details**: Once you type amount value. You'll see the available quote details as received amount, network fee, maximum slippage, or price impact. 
6. **Confirm Swap**: Review the swap details, including the transaction fee, and confirm the swap.

## Integration

The Swaps feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required. 

If you prefer to disable it, set the `swaps` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createAppKit` function.

```ts {7}
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata: metadata,
  features: {
    swaps: false // Optional - true by default
  }
})
```

## Setting Default Tokens

You can programmatically open the Swap view with pre-selected tokens and amounts using the `open` function from the `useAppKit` hook. This allows you to customize the default swap experience for your users.

```ts
import { useAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'

function Component() {
  const { open } = useAppKit()

  const openSwapWithDefaults = () => {
    open({
      view: 'Swap',
      arguments: {
        amount: '100',      // Optional: pre-fill the swap amount
        fromToken: 'USDC',  // Optional: set the token to swap from
        toToken: 'ETH'      // Optional: set the token to swap to
      }
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={openSwapWithDefaults}>Swap USDC to ETH</button>
}
```

### Parameters

- `amount` (optional): Pre-fill the amount to swap
- `fromToken` (optional): Set the default token to swap from (e.g., 'USDC', 'ETH', 'DAI')
- `toToken` (optional): Set the default token to swap to (e.g., 'ETH', 'USDC', 'USDT')

This is particularly useful when you want to guide users to swap specific tokens or create custom swap buttons for different token pairs in your application.
