**Reown Authentication is our flagship SIWX (Sign In With X) solution** - the recommended way to handle user authentication for modern web3 applications. Built specifically for multi-chain environments, it abstracts away the complexity of validating wallets across **EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin networks**.

With Reown Authentication you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users, get insights and much more. Read more about [Reown Authentication](/cloud/reown-authentication) features in the dedicated documentation.

<Warning>
  `ReownAuthentication` was previously named `CloudAuthSIWX`, it has been renamed since version `1.7.13`. If you were using
  the previous class, you will not need to update your code, both class names work identically.
</Warning>

### Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-siwx
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-siwx
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-siwx
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-siwx
```

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

```typescript {3,10}
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit'
// Add the following code line
import { ReownAuthentication } from '@reown/appkit-siwx'

const appkit = createAppKit({
  projectId,
  networks,
  metadata,
  // Add the following code line
  siwx: new ReownAuthentication()
})
```

Now your Dapp is ready to use the **Reown Authentication** within your SIWX configuration.

### Extra configuration

With `ReownAuthentication` you don't need to do anything else, it will work out of the box, but you can configure some parameters to customize the experience.

#### Available Parameters

```typescript
new ReownAuthentication({
  localAuthStorageKey?: string    // Default: '@appkit/siwx-auth-token'
  localNonceStorageKey?: string   // Default: '@appkit/siwx-nonce-token'
  required?: boolean              // Default: true
})
```

#### Examples

**Custom storage keys:**

```typescript
new ReownAuthentication({
  localAuthStorageKey: 'my-app-auth',
  localNonceStorageKey: 'my-app-nonce'
})
```

**Optional authentication (wallet stays connected if user denies signing):**

```typescript
new ReownAuthentication({
  required: false
})
```
