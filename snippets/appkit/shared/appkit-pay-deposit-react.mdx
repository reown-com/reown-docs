**Deposit with Exchange** gives your users a seamless way to fund their connected wallets directly from centralized exchange accounts like Coinbase and Binance (with more exchanges coming soon). Instead of forcing users to leave your app, log into their exchange, and manually handle withdrawals, you can offer a guided in-app flow that keeps them engaged and ready to transact.

## Pre-Requisites

**To enable this feature, you will need to provide your own Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) API keys.**

You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp-&-offramp/introduction/getting-started).

Head over to [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com) and navigate to the "Fund from Exchange" section to configure your API keys.

## Quickstart 

This feature will start working as soon as your team is on the allowed-list. Contact us [via our form here](https://share.hsforms.com/1_oWa8QkwRXi6oR0nZ_SIxQnxw6s) to get started.

<Warning>
    Projects first need to install and set up Reown AppKit before integrating Pay. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Reown docs](/appkit/overview#quickstart).

Clicking on Fund your wallet will show the modal below:

### Install the library

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-pay
```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage
Import the `baseUSDC` asset, the `pay` function and the `useAppKitAccount` hook to get the address of the connected wallet.
```ts

import { baseUSDC, pay } from '@reown/appkit-pay';
import { useAppKitAccount  } from '@reown/appkit/react'
```

Get the address of the connected wallet using the `useAppKitAccount` hook. You can also check if the user is connected using the `isConnected` boolean.
```ts
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount()
```

In order to run the deposit, use the function `pay`. This function receives three values.

```ts
// pay function returns a PaymentResult object
const result = await pay({ 
    recipient: address,
    amount: 0.0001,
    paymentAsset: baseUSDC
});

if (result.success) {
    console.log("Payment successful: "+ result.result);
} else {
    console.error("Payment error: "+ result.error);
}
```

## Supported Networks and Assets

For a complete list of supported networks and assets across different exchanges (Coinbase, Binance), please refer to the [Networks and Assets Supported](/appkit/payments/pay-with-exchange#networks-and-assets-supported) section in our Pay with Exchange documentation.

## Assets Configuration

For the moment, Pay has pre-configured these assets: 
- baseETH, baseSepoliaETH, and baseUSDC
- ethereumUSDC, optimismUSDC, arbitrumUSDC, polygonUSDC and solanaUSDC
- ethereumUSDT, optimismUSDT, arbitrumUSDT, polygonUSDT and solanaUSDT

```ts
import { baseETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

For custom assets, you can create a paymentAsset object with all the information:

```ts
// Configure the paymentAsset
const paymentAssetDetails = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: 'native', // Or USDC in Base: '0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913'
    metadata: {
        name: 'Ethereum', // Or 'USD Coin'
        symbol: 'ETH',    // Or 'USDC'
        decimals: 18      // Or 6 for USDC
    }
};
```
