Custom connectors allow you to integrate wallets that are not natively supported by AppKit.

## Adding Custom Connectors

You can add custom connectors to your AppKit configuration:

```ts
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit'
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'
import { mainnet, arbitrum } from '@reown/appkit/networks'

const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  projectId
})

const appKit = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  projectId,
  connectors: [
    // Add your custom connectors here
  ]
})
```

For more information on creating custom connectors, refer to the [Wagmi documentation](https://wagmi.sh/core/connectors/custom).
