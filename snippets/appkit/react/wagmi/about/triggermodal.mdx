To open Reown you can use our [**web component**](/appkit/react/core/components) or build your own button with Reown [**hooks**](/appkit/react/core/hooks#useAppKit).
In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don't require importing.

```tsx
export default function ConnectButton() {
  return <appkit-button />
}
```
