In your `main.js` file set up the following configuration.

```ts
import { createAppKit } from "@reown/appkit";
import { Ethers5Adapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-ethers5";
import { mainnet, arbitrum } from "@reown/appkit/networks";

// 1. Get projectId at https://dashboard.reown.com
const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";

// 2. Create your application's metadata object
const metadata = {
  name: "My Website",
  description: "My Website description",
  url: "https://mywebsite.com", // url must match your domain & subdomain
  icons: ["https://avatars.mywebsite.com/"],
};

// 3. Create a AppKit instance
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [new Ethers5Adapter()],
  metadata: metadata,
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  projectId,
  features: {
    analytics: true, // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
  },
});
```

<Warning>
Make sure that the `url` from the `metadata` matches your domain and subdomain. This will later be used by the [Verify API](../../../cloud/verify) to tell wallets if your application has been verified or not.
</Warning>
