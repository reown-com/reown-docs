You can also select the modal's view when calling the `open` function

```ts
open({ view: "Account" });

// to connect and show multi wallets view
open({ view: "Connect" });

// to connect and show only solana wallets
open({ view: "Connect", namespace: "solana" });

// to connect and show only bitcoin wallets
open({ view: "Connect", namespace: "bip122" });

// to connect and show only ethereum wallets
open({ view: "Connect", namespace: "eip155" });

// to open swap with arguments
open({
  view: 'Swap',
  arguments: {
    amount: '321.123',
    fromToken: 'USDC',
    toToken: 'ETH'
  }
})

// to open wallet send interface
open({ view: 'WalletSend' })
```
