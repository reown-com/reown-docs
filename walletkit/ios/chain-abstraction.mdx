## Methods

The following methods from WalletKit are used in implementing chain abstraction.

<Info>
ðŸ’¡ Chain abstraction is currently in the early access phase, use with careful
</Info>

### Prepare 

This method is used to check if chain abstraction is needed. If it is, it will return a response with the necessary transactions. 
If it is not, it will return a response with the original transaction. 

```swift
@available(*, message: "This method is experimental. Use with caution.")
public func prepare(chainId: String, from: FfiAddress, call: Call, accounts: [String], localCurrency: Currency) async throws -> PrepareDetailedResponse 
}
```

### Execute

This method is used to execute the chain abstraction operation. The method will handle broadcasting all transactions in the correct order and monitor the cross-chain transfer process. It returns an `ExecuteDetails` object with the transaction status and results.

```swift
@available(*, message: "This method is experimental. Use with caution.")
public func execute(uiFields: UiFields, routeTxnSigs: [FfiPrimitiveSignature], initialTxnSig: FfiPrimitiveSignature) async throws -> ExecuteDetails {
}
```

## Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. Call the `execute` method to broadcast the routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed. 

If the operation is successful, you need to broadcast the initial transaction and await the transaction hash and receipt. 
If the operation is not successful, send a JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user. 

```swift
let routeResponseSuccess = try await WalletKit.instance.ChainAbstraction.prepare(
    chainId: selectedNetwork.chainId.absoluteString,
    from: myAccount.address,
    call: call,
    accounts: caip10Accounts,
    localCurrency: .usd
)

switch routeResponseSuccess {
case .success(let routeResponse):
    switch routeResponse {
    case .available(let UiFileds):
        // If the route is available, present a CA transaction flow
        for txnDetails in uiFields.route {
            let hash = txnDetails.transactionHashToSign
            let sig = try! signer.signHash(hash)
            routeTxnSigs.append(sig)
        }
        
        // sign initial transaction hash
        let initialTxHash = uiFields.initial.transactionHashToSign
        let initialTxnSig = try! signer.signHash(initialTxHash)      
        
        let executeDetails = try await WalletKit.instance.ChainAbstraction.execute(uiFields: uiFields, routeTxnSigs: routeTxnSigs, initialTxnSig: initialTxnSig)
        
    case .notRequired:
        // user does not need to move funds from other chains, sign and broadcast original transaction
        
    }
case .error(let routeResponseError):
    // Show an error
}
```

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Example/WalletApp/PresentationLayer/Wallet/CATransactionModal/CATransactionPresenter.swift) with Swift.

## Testing 

Best way to test Chain Abstraction is to use [sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp).
You can also use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/appkit/?name=wagmi) and try sending any supported [tokens](../../../walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction-supported wallet.
