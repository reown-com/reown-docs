## Initialization

Confirm you have configured the [Network Client](/advanced/api/core/relay) first.

Starting from WalletConnect SDK version 1.9.5, the `redirect` field in the `AppMetadata` object is mandatory. Ensure that the provided value matches your app's URL scheme to prevent redirection-related issues.

Once you're done, in order to initialize a client just call a `configure` method from the WalletKit instance wrapper

```swift
let telemetryEnabled = true;
let metadata = AppMetadata(
    name: "Example Wallet",
    description: "Wallet description",
    url: "example.wallet",
    icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
    redirect: AppMetadata.Redirect(native: "example://", universal: nil)
)

WalletKit.configure(
    metadata: metadata,
    crypto: DefaultCryptoProvider(),
    // Used for the Push: "echo.walletconnect.com" will be used by default if not provided
    pushHost: "echo.walletconnect.com",
    // Used for the Push: "APNSEnvironment.production" will be used by default if not provided
    environment: .production,
    telemetryEnabled: telemetryEnabled
)
```

In order to allow users to receive push notifications you have to communicate with Apple Push Notification service and receive unique device token. Register that token with following method:

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.register(deviceToken: deviceToken)
```

The telemetry feature aims to enhance the reliability and observability of connection flows between decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets. It focuses solely on collecting data related to code execution and error codes, without tracking any sensitive user information such as amounts, accounts, etc.

It provides a comprehensive tracing system for three key use cases:

- Subscribing to a Pairing Topic
- Approving a Session
- Approving an Authenticated Session

Each execution trace consists of:

- Trace Events: Collected to verify the proper execution of code.
- Error Events: Captured when errors occur during the trace, halting the execution trace.

When an error event is encountered, it is stored locally within the SDK along with all preceding trace events.
These stored events are then transmitted to the server whenever the SDK is initialized.

Error event tracing is enabled by default.

**Telemetry Enabled (telemetryEnabled = true):**

- The SDK stores events and sends them to the server.

**Telemetry Disabled (telemetryEnabled = false):**

- The SDK stops storing new events and deletes all unsent events from local storage upon the next initialization.

Important Note: Since the SDK only stores abstract trace and error data, user identification is not possible.

Example of the error events:

```json
[
  {
    "eventId": "69e53f11-fd4b-4efc-8d36-1f60a9ac8207",
    "bundleId": "com.wallet.example",
    "timestamp": 1689611327943,
    "props": {
      "event": "ERROR",
      "type": "pairing_already_exists",
      "properties": {
        "topic": "topic1",
        "trace": [
          "pairing_started",
          "pairing_uri_validation_success",
          "pairing_uri_not_expired",
          "existing_pairing",
          "pairing_not_expired",
          "pairing_not_expired"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "eventId": "69e53f11-fd4b-4efc-8d36-2321312fds",
    "bundleId": "com.wallet.example",
    "timestamp": 16896113234323,
    "props": {
      "event": "ERROR",
      "type": "session_approve_namespace_validation_failure",
      "properties": {
        "topic": "topic2",
        "trace": ["session_approve_started", "proposal_not_expired"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Session

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

`AutoNamespaces` is a helper utility that greatly reduces the complexity of parsing the required and optional namespaces. It accepts as parameters a session proposal along with your user's chains/methods/events/accounts and returns ready-to-use `SessionNamespace` object.

```swift
public static func build(
    sessionProposal: Session.Proposal,
    chains: [Blockchain],
    methods: [String],
    events: [String],
    accounts: [Account]
) throws -> [String: SessionNamespace]
```

Example usage

```swift
do {
    sessionNamespaces = try AutoNamespaces.build(
        sessionProposal: proposal,
        chains: [Blockchain("eip155:1")!, Blockchain("eip155:137")!],
        methods: ["eth_sendTransaction", "personal_sign"],
        events: ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"],
        accounts: [
            Account(blockchain: Blockchain("eip155:1")!, address: "0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb")!,
            Account(blockchain: Blockchain("eip155:137")!, address: "0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb")!
        ]
    )
} catch let error as AutoNamespacesError {
    // reject session proposal if AutoNamespace build function threw
    try await reject(proposal: proposal, reason: RejectionReason(from: error))
    return
}
// approve session with sessionNamespaces
try await WalletKit.instance.approve(proposalId: proposal.id, namespaces: sessionNamespaces)

```

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

```ts
{
  //...
  methods: [
    "eth_accounts",
    "eth_requestAccounts",
    "eth_sendRawTransaction",
    "eth_sign",
    "eth_signTransaction",
    "eth_signTypedData",
    "eth_signTypedData_v3",
    "eth_signTypedData_v4",
    "eth_sendTransaction",
    "personal_sign",
    "wallet_switchEthereumChain",
    "wallet_addEthereumChain",
    "wallet_getPermissions",
    "wallet_requestPermissions",
    "wallet_registerOnboarding",
    "wallet_watchAsset",
    "wallet_scanQRCode",
    "wallet_sendCalls",
    "wallet_getCallsStatus",
    "wallet_showCallsStatus",
    "wallet_getCapabilities",
  ],
  events: [
    "chainChanged",
    "accountsChanged",
    "message",
    "disconnect",
    "connect",
  ]
}
```

### Session Approval

```swift
 WalletKit.instance.approve(
    proposalId: "proposal_id",
    namespaces: sessionNamespaces
)
```

When session is successfully approved `sessionsPublishers` will publish a `Session`

```swift
WalletKit.instance.sessionsPublishers
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] _ in
        self?.reloadSessions()
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```

`Session` object represents an active session connection with a dapp. It contains dappâ€™s metadata (that you may want to use for displaying an active session to the user), namespaces, and expiry date. There is also a topic property that you will use for linking requests with related sessions.

You can always query settled sessions from the client later with:

```swift
WalletKit.instance.getSessions()
```

#### Connect Clients

Your Wallet should allow users to scan a QR code generated by dapps. You are responsible for implementing it on your own.
For testing, you can use our test dapp at: https://react-app.walletconnect.com/, which is v2 protocol compliant.
Once you derive a URI from the QR code call `pair` method:

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.pair(uri: uri)
```

if everything goes well, you should handle following event:

```swift
WalletKit.instance.sessionProposalPublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] session in
        self?.verifyDapp(session.context)
        self?.showSessionProposal(session.proposal)
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```

Session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it's purpose is to define a session rules. Handshake procedure is defined by [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md).
`Session.Proposal` object conveys set of required and optional `ProposalNamespaces` that contains blockchains methods and events. Dapp requests with methods and wallet will emit events defined in namespaces.

`VerifyContext` provides a domain verification information about `Session.Proposal` and `Request`. It consists of origin of a Dapp from where the request has been sent, validation enum that says whether origin is **unknown**, **valid** or **invalid** and verify URL server.

To enable or disable verification find the **Verify SDK** toggle in your project [dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com).

```swift
public struct VerifyContext: Equatable, Hashable {
   public enum ValidationStatus {
       case unknown
       case valid
       case invalid
   }

   public let origin: String?
   public let validation: ValidationStatus
   public let verifyUrl: String
}
```

The user will either approve the session proposal (with session namespaces) or reject it. Session namespaces must at least contain requested methods, events and accounts associated with proposed blockchains.

Accounts must be provided according to [CAIP10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md) specification and be prefixed with a chain identifier. chain_id + : + account_address. You can find more on blockchain identifiers in [CAIP2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md). Our `Account` type meets the criteria.

```
let account = Account("eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb")!
```

Accounts sent in session approval must at least match all requested blockchains.

Example proposal namespaces request:

```json
{
  "eip155": {
    "chains": ["eip155:137", "eip155:1"],
    "methods": ["eth_sign"],
    "events": ["accountsChanged"]
  },
  "cosmos": {
    "chains": ["cosmos:cosmoshub-4"],
    "methods": ["cosmos_signDirect"],
    "events": ["someCosmosEvent"]
  }
}
```

Example session namespaces response:

```json
{
  "eip155": {
    "accounts": [
      "eip155:137:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb",
      "eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb"
    ],
    "methods": ["eth_sign"],
    "events": ["accountsChanged"]
  },
  "cosmos": {
    "accounts": [
      "cosmos:cosmoshub-4:cosmos1t2uflqwqe0fsj0shcfkrvpukewcw40yjj6hdc0"
    ],
    "methods": ["cosmos_signDirect", "personal_sign"],
    "events": ["someCosmosEvent", "proofFinalized"]
  }
}
```

#### Track Sessions

When your `WalletKit` instance receives requests from a peer it will publish a related event. Set a subscription to handle them.

To track sessions subscribe to `sessionsPublisher` publisher

```swift
WalletKit.instance.sessionsPublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] sessions in
        // Reload UI
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```

### Session Rejection

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.reject(requestId: request.id)
```

### Responding to Session requests

After the session is established, a dapp will request your wallet's users to sign a transaction or a message. Requests will be delivered by the following publisher.

```swift
WalletKit.instance.sessionRequestPublisher
  .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
  .sink { [weak self] session in
      self?.verifyDapp(session.context)
      self?.showSessionRequest(session.request)
  }.store(in: &publishers)
```

When a wallet receives a session request, you probably want to show it to the user. Itâ€™s method will be in scope of session namespaces. And itâ€™s params are represented by `AnyCodable` type. An expected object can be derived as follows:

```swift
if sessionRequest.method == "personal_sign" {
    let params = try! sessionRequest.params.get([String].self)
} else if method == "eth_signTypedData" {
    let params = try! sessionRequest.params.get([String].self)
} else if method == "eth_sendTransaction" {
    let params = try! sessionRequest.params.get([EthereumTransaction].self)
}
```

Now, your wallet (as it owns your userâ€™s private keys) is responsible for signing the transaction. After doing it, you can send a response to a dapp.

```swift
let response: AnyCodable = sign(request: sessionRequest) // Implement your signing method
try await WalletKit.instance.respond(topic: request.topic, requestId: request.id, response: .response(response))
```

### Updating a Session

If you want to update user session's chains, accounts, methods or events you can use session update method.

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.update(topic: session.topic, namespaces: newNamespaces)
```

### Extending a Session

By default, session lifetime is set for 7 days and after that time user's session will expire. But if you consider that a session should be extended you can call:

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.extend(topic: session.topic)
```

Above method will extend a user's session to a week.

### Session Disconnect

For good user experience your wallet should allow users to disconnect unwanted sessions. In order to terminate a session use `disconnect` method.

```swift
try await WalletKit.instance.disconnect(topic: session.topic)
```

### Subscribe for WalletKit Publishers

The following publishers are available to subscribe:

```swift
public var sessionProposalPublisher: AnyPublisher<(proposal: Session.Proposal, context: VerifyContext?), Never>
public var sessionRequestPublisher: AnyPublisher<(request: Request, context: VerifyContext?), Never>
public var authRequestPublisher: AnyPublisher<(request: AuthRequest, context: VerifyContext?), Never>
public var sessionPublisher: AnyPublisher<[Session], Never>
public var socketConnectionStatusPublisher: AnyPublisher<SocketConnectionStatus, Never>
public var sessionSettlePublisher: AnyPublisher<Session, Never>
public var sessionDeletePublisher: AnyPublisher<(String, Reason), Never>
public var sessionResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<Response, Never>
```

### Register Device Token

To register a wallet to receive WalletConnect push notifications, call `register` method and pass the device token received from the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` method in the `AppDelegate`.

```swift

WalletKit.instance.register(deviceToken: deviceToken, enableEncrypted: true)

```
