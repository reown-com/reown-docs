If you are on **Android** add jitpack support to your android (project's) build.gradle file

 ```
 allprojects {
     repositories {
         google()
         mavenCentral()
         maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // <- add jipack url
     }
 }
 ```

If you are on **MacOS** add the following to your `DebugProfile.entitlements` and `Release.entitlements` files to connect to the WebSocket server.

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```
