## Usage

Mobile Linking allows your wallet to automatically redirect back to the Dapp allowing for less user interactions and hence a better UX for your users.

### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it's essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1. **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It's like saying, "Hey, let's chat!"
2. **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042?hl=en#:~:text=Deep%20links%20send%20mobile%20device,%2C%20Shopping%2C%20and%20Display%20campaigns.) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

<Tip>

**Developers should prefer Deep Linking over Universal Linking.**

Universal Linking may redirect the user to a browser, which might not provide the intended user experience. Deep Linking ensures the user is taken directly to the app.

</Tip>

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp).
Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

- **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

The connection and sign request flows are similar across platforms.

### Connection Flow

- **Dapp Prompts User:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
- **User Chooses Wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
- **Redirect to Wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
- **Wallet Approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
- **Return to Dapp:**
  - **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
  - **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
- **User Reunites with Dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

- **Automatic Redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
- **Approval Prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
- **Return to Dapp:**
  - **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
  - **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
- **User Reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

## Platform preparations

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">

In order for Dapps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to add your custom scheme under [`CFBundleURLTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleurltypes) key in your Info.plist file.

For instance, if your Wallet's name is Example Wallet, your custom scheme would be more likely as `examplewallet://`, therefor you will add the following in your iOS's Info.plist file:

```ruby
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
		<string>Editor</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
		<string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
		<array>
			<string>examplewallet</string> <!-- your custom scheme goes here -->
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Android">
In order for Dapps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to declare an [`<intent-filter>`](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking#adding-filters) in your wallet's Manifest.xml as follows:

For instance, if your Wallet's name is Example Wallet, your custom scheme would be more likely as `examplewallet://`, therefor you will add the following intent filter in your Android's Manifest.xml file:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="examplewallet" /> <!-- your own custom scheme -->
</intent-filter>
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Flutter">

Since Flutter leverages on native APIs, you must follow iOS and Android steps for each native platform.

**Additionally**, you would have to set FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled key to true on iOS's Info.plist file.

```xml
<key>FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

<Tip>

Dapps developers must do the same for their own custom schemes if they want the wallet to be able to navigate back after a session approval or a sign request response

</Tip>

## Integration

Either you are approving a session proposal or responding to a session request, redirecting back to the Dapp is as simply as launching requester's `redirect` object in `PairingMetadata`, the same way as Dapps would call your wallet's `redirect` object on their side:

A dapp would call `examplewallet://wc?uri={pairingUri}` from their side when they request to connect with your wallet, and given the fact that `examplewallet` is your registered custom scheme then your wallet will be opened.

### Redirecting back to dapp (proposer) after session approval:

WalletKit SDK exports a handy method for easy redirection back to the requester app, whether it be after a session proposal, a session authentication or a session request.

```javascript
Future<bool> redirectToDapp({
  required String topic,
  required Redirect? redirect,
})
```

After Session Proposal:

```javascript
_walletKit!.onSessionProposal.subscribe(_onSessionProposal);
//
void _onSessionProposal(SessionProposalEvent? event) async {
  if (event != null) {
    // Process session proposal
    // ....
    // Redirect back to proposer dapp
    try {
      await _walletKit.redirectToDapp(
        topic: topic,
        redirect: event.params.proposer.metadata.redirect,
      );
    } catch (e) {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

After Session Authenticate:

```javascript
// If your wallet supports One-Click Auth
_walletKit!.onSessionAuthRequest.subscribe(_onSessionAuthRequest);
//
void _onSessionAuthRequest(SessionAuthRequest? event) async {
  if (event != null) {
    // Process session authentication
    // ....
    // Redirect back to proposer dapp
    try {
      await _walletKit.redirectToDapp(
        topic: topic,
        redirect: event.params.proposer.metadata.redirect,
      );
    } catch (e) {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

A dapp would call `examplewallet://` (or even better `session.peer?.metadata.redirect?.native` object) from their side when they request to sign a transaction, and given the fact that `session.peer?.metadata.redirect?.native` contains your registered custom scheme (`examplewallet://`) then your wallet will be opened.

**Redirecting back to dapp (proposer) after responding to a sign request:**

```javascript
// Your registered request handler for the given requested method will be triggered
Future<void> personalSignRequestHandler(String topic, dynamic parameters) async {
  // Process signing requests
  // ...
  // With the given topic with retrieve the current session data
  final session = _walletKit.sessions.get(topic);
  // And we get the peer metadata to trigger dapp's redirect value
  try {
    await _walletKit.redirectToDapp(
      topic: topic,
      redirect: session!.peer.metadata.redirect,
    );
  } catch (e) {
    ...
  }
}
```

<Info>

`launchUrlString()` from [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) official package was used as an example to explain the mechanism, you can choose whatever other package you would like.
