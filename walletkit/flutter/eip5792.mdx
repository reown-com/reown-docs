title: Wallet Call API
---

WalletConnect supports [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792#atomicbatch-capability), which defines new JSON-RPC methods that enable apps to ask a wallet to process a batch of onchain write calls and to check on the status of those calls.
Applications can specify that these onchain calls be executed taking advantage of specific capabilities previously expressed by the wallet; an additional, a novel wallet RPC is defined to enable apps to query the wallet for those capabilities.

- `wallet_sendCalls`: Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls.
- `wallet_getCallsStatus`: Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via wallet_sendCalls.
- `wallet_showCallsStatus`: Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with wallet_sendCalls.
- `wallet_getCapabilities`: This RPC allows an application to request capabilities from a wallet (e.g. batch transactions, paymaster communication).

  ## Capabilities in CAIP-25 Connection Requests

CAIP-25 defines how capabilities can be expressed in wallet-to-dapp connections. These capabilities control how methods like `wallet_sendCalls` behave.

### Session Properties

In a connection request, dapps can request capabilities via `sessionProperties`. These can be universal (across all chains) or chain-specific:

```json
"sessionProperties": {
  "expiry": "2022-12-24T17:07:31+00:00",
  "caip154": {
    "supported": "true"
  },
  "flow-control": {
    "loose": [], 
    "strict": [],
    "exoticThirdThing": []
  },
  "atomic": {
    "status": "supported"
  }
}
```

### Scoped Properties

For chain-specific capabilities, dapps use `scopedProperties`:

```json
"scopedProperties": {
  "eip155:8453": {
    "paymasterService": {
      "supported": true
    },
    "sessionKeys": {
      "supported": true
    }
  },
  "eip155:84532": {
    "auxiliaryFunds": {
      "supported": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Wallet Response

A wallet's response should indicate which capabilities it actually supports, following EIP-5792 and CAIP-25:

```json
"sessionProperties": {
  "expiry": "2022-12-24T17:07:31+00:00",
  "caip154": {
    "supported": "true"
  },
  "flow-control": {
    "loose": ["halt", "continue"],
    "strict": ["continue"]
  },
  "atomic": {
    "status": "ready"
  }
},
"scopedProperties": {
  "eip155:1": {
    "atomic": {
      "status": "supported"
    }
  },
  "eip155:137": {
    "atomic": {
      "status": "unsupported"
    }
  },
  "eip155:84532": {
    "eip155:83532:0x0910e12C68d02B561a34569E1367c9AAb42bd810": {
      "auxiliaryFunds": {
        "supported": false
      },
      "atomic": {
        "status": "supported"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Capabilities shared across all address in a namespace can be expressed at top-level
- Address-specific capabilities can include exceptions to scope-wide capabilities

### Atomic Capability

According to EIP-5792, the `atomic` capability specifies how the wallet will execute batches of transactions. It has three possible values:

- `supported` - The wallet will execute calls atomically and contiguously
- `ready` - The wallet can upgrade to support atomic execution pending user approval
- `unsupported` - The wallet provides no atomicity guarantees

This capability is expressed per chain and is crucial for determining how `wallet_sendCalls` with `atomicRequired: true` will be handled.

  ### Example
    The `wallet_getCapabilities` method is used to request information about what capabilities a wallet supports. Following EIP-5792, here's how it should be implemented:

    #### Request
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "wallet_getCapabilities",
      "params": ["0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567", ["0x2105", "0x14A34"]]
    }
    ```

    #### Response
    The wallet should return a response following EIP-5792, where capabilities are organized by chain ID:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "result": {
        "0x2105": {
          "atomic": {
            "status": "supported"
          }
        },
        "0x14A34": {
          "atomic": {
            "status": "unsupported"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

    ### Implementation
    When implementing `wallet_sendCalls`, wallets must follow these requirements:

    #### Connection Approval
    - Only approve this method during the connection approval flow if your wallet can implement it correctly
    - Define the `atomic` capability per chain/account in the CAIP-25 response

    #### Request Format
    ```json
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "version": "2.0",
      "method": "wc_sessionRequest",
      "params": {
        "chainId": "caip-2-chain-id",
        "request": {
          "method": "wallet_sendCalls",
          "params": {
            "from": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
            "chainId": "0x01",
            "atomicRequired": true,
            "calls": [
              {
                "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
                "value": "0x9184e72a",
                "data": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"
              },
              {
                "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
                "value": "0x182183",
                "data": "0xfbadbaf01"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    #### Core Implementation Requirements
    - Execute calls in the exact order specified in the request
    - Do not wait for any calls to be finalized before completing the batch
    - If the user rejects the request, do not send any calls

    #### Atomic Execution Behavior
    When `atomicRequired` is `true`:
    - Execute all calls atomically (either all succeed or none have any effect)
    - Execute all calls contiguously (no other transactions between batch calls)
    - If your wallet can upgrade from `ready` to `supported` atomicity, do so before executing

    When `atomicRequired` is `false`:
    - You may execute calls sequentially without atomicity guarantees
    - You may execute atomically if your wallet supports it
    - You may upgrade to `supported` atomicity and execute atomically

    #### Response Enrichment
    To enhance the user experience and eliminate the need for app switching, wallets can enrich the wallet_sendCalls response with caip2 id and transactionHash to let the Universal Provider resolve the transaction hash.

    ```json
    {
      "id": "...",
      "capabilities": {
        "caip345": {
          "caip2": "eip155:1",
          "transactionHashes": ["..."],
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="wallet_getCallsStatus">
    ### Example
    To enhance the user experience and eliminate the need for app switching, wallets can enrich the wallet_sendCalls response with caip2 id and transactionHash to let the Universal Provider resolve the transaction hash.

     To implement this functionality, the response for wallet_sendCalls should be enriched with capabilities:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "...",
      "capabilities": {
        "caip345": {
          "caip2": "eip155:1",
          "transactionHashes": ["..."],
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Specify the `scopedProperties` when approving a session:

    ```json
    "scopedProperties": {
      "eip155": {
        "walletService": [{
          "url": "<wallet service URL>",
          "methods": ["wallet_getCallsStatus"]
        }]
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Response Format
    The response format for `wallet_getCallsStatus` varies based on the execution method:

    #### For Atomic Execution
    ```json
    {
      "receipts": [/* single receipt or array of receipts */],
      "atomic": true
    }
    ```

    #### For Non-Atomic Execution
    ```json
    {
      "receipts": [/* array of receipts for all transactions */],
      "atomic": false
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    For non-atomic execution, include all transactions in the receipts array, even those that were included on-chain but eventually reverted.
