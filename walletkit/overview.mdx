Some of the key features of WalletKit include:

- **Sign API**: Allows dapps to request that the user sign a transaction or message.
- **Auth API**: Allows dapps to verify wallet address ownership through a single signature request, realizing login in one action.
- **Chain agnostic**: WalletKit is designed to work with any blockchain, so you can easily support multiple chains without having to write separate integration code.
