**AppKit Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their **Centralized Exchange (CEX) accounts** like Binance or Coinbase, **with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.** This flow is bundled together with the **Pay with Self-Custodial Wallets** flow.

This feature brings together Reown's vast ecosystem of wallets and onchain infrastructure to offer:

- **Fewer clicks, higher conversion**: Seamless checkout within the Centralized Exchange (CEX) UI.

- **No credentials shared**: Secure flow with no handling of user logins, credentials, or private keys.

- **Instant integration for PSPs**: Payments settle onchain, using existing reconciliation systems.

- **Fallback-friendly**: If the exchange balance is low, users can onramp and complete the payment in the same flow.

With **72% of crypto users holding funds on exchanges**, **Pay with Exchange** helps payment providers tap into where users actually keep their assets and turn more intent into successful transactions.

***A direct integration from CEX to checkout. No wallet needed, no friction, and no compromises.***

## Pay with Exchange FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is 'Pay with Exchange'?">
    Pay with Exchange is a flow that allows users to pay in crypto directly from their Centralized Exchange (CEX) accounts; starting with **Binance** and **Coinbase**. 
    
    It allows users to complete payments without needing to move funds into a wallet first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from on-ramps?">
    **On-ramps** convert fiat to crypto in order to fund user's own wallet. They often require full KYC at the time of the onramp.
    
    **Pay with Exchange** is designed to skips these steps by letting users pay directly from their exchange account, reducing UX friction and dropout. Pay with Exchange is designed to support payments to any address.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which exchanges are supported?">
    Coinbase and Binance. More exchanges will be added, so please reach out to sales@reown.com to inquire.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What crypto assets and networks are supported?">
    Check the [Networks and Assets Supported](#networks-and-assets-supported) section for an up to date list of supported assets and networks.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### User Experience

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the user selects an unsupported token or network?">
    If the selected token or network is not supported, **the exchange is automatically hidden from the user interface** to prevent confusion or failure. This ensures users are only presented with viable payment routes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a user cancels mid-flow?">
    If a user abandons the flow after being redirected to the exchange, **no transaction occurs**. Reown only provides a payment confirmation **after the exchange executes the withdrawal**. Apps can implement timeout logic to handle cancellations gracefully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What UX do users see inside the exchange? Is it branded or generic?">
    Once redirected to the exchange, the user sees the **native exchange UI**. Reown does **not inject branding or control the in-exchange experience**, ensuring a secure, familiar flow for the user and no compromise on exchange login or withdrawal authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the user is not logged onto their exchange?">
    If the user doesnâ€™t have an active browser session with the exchange, they will be prompted to log in by the exchange.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle failed or delayed withdrawals?">
    Reown monitors confirmations but cannot intervene in CEX operations. Apps should be designed to handle failures and delays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can users cancel the payment after confirming on the exchange?">
    No, users cannot cancel the payment after confirming on the exchange.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a payment fails on the CEX side?">
    If a withdrawal fails:
    
    - The user remains in the exchange interface and will typically see the error there.
    - **Reown does not emit a confirmation**, so apps can assume the transaction was not completed.
    - Apps should handle retries or offer alternate payment methods like a wallet-based option
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the user doesn't have enough funds on the exchange?">
    The user will be able to use the exchange interface to buy crypto currency and complete the payment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can we customize branding and UI?">
    Pay with Exchange is available as a **headless** option, allowing full UI customization by developers. Exchange branding and UI cannot be customized.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### Compliance, Security & Observability

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is KYC required for the user?">
    Yes, implicitly. Since users are transacting through CEX accounts, the exchanges' own KYC policies apply.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there Travel Rule implications?">
    Possibly. Reown itself does not mediate exchange-to-exchange transactions, but **PSPs are responsible** for their Travel Rule compliance and ensuring they can accept transfers from CEXes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Reown custody any user funds?">
    No. All transactions occur **within the exchange interface**. Reown **never stores or accesses** user credentials or funds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can we monitor transactions in real time?">
    Yes. AppKit provides **blockchain** **transaction IDs** upon payment confirmation, which can be used for real-time monitoring and reconciliation.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### Integration & Support

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do we integrate this into our checkout or app flow?">
    Pay with Exchange is part of AppKit Pay, it is available as a modal and a headless flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does a full integration typically take?">
    For developers already using AppKit, integration is estimated to take **less than a day**. New customers must first complete the AppKit SDK integration, which typically takes a few days depending on team setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's your uptime guarantee?">
    Reown guarantees 99.9% uptime for paid customers, 90-day uptime can be found [here](https://status.reown.com/).
    
    Availability of a particular exchange will also depend on the exchange uptime.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### Pricing & Fees

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does it cost to use Pay with Exchange?">
    Reown uses a **tiered pricing model**, calculated on the USD value of processed payments. These fees are billed to Reown's customers monthly, and not applied to end users at the time of payment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there overage fees or API rate limits?">
    Yes, if usage exceeds AppKit tier limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who pays the network fees?">
    The **end user covers network fees**, as these are embedded in the exchange withdrawal process. They depend on the network, and can fluctuate without notice due to factors such as network congestion. Network fees are disclosed to the user as part of the exchange experience, and can sometimes be called exchange withdrawal fees.
    Binance fees can be found [here](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Any other fees end users are subjected to?">
    If the user opts to buy crypto currency on the exchange instead of using available crypto balance, they may be subject to exchange trading fees. These will be shown to the user, broken down by exchange fees and network (withdrawal) fees.
