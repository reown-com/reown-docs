**AppKit Pay Subscriptions & Recurring Payments** makes it simple for apps and payment providers to support **automated, repeat crypto payments**, whether it's a monthly subscription, metered billing, or usage-based pricing.

Designed with both compliance and UX in mind, this feature leverages onchain primitives to enable:

- **User-friendly consent flows**: Clear opt-ins with wallet-native approval steps.
- **Flexible billing cycles**: Support for daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence.
- **Network-agnostic support**: Works across EVM, Bitcoin, and Solana ecosystems.
- **Built-in failover and retry logic**: Improve reliability and reduce missed payments.

No need to roll your own billing logic or ask users to manually approve every transaction. AppKit handles the complexity so you can focus on delivering value.

***Predictable revenue. Seamless experience. Fully onchain.***
