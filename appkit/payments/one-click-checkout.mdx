Designed for mobile-first commerce, this feature uses Reown's vast ecosystem of wallets and onchain UX infrastructure to deliver:

- **Instant wallet recognition**: Automatically detects the userâ€™s preferred wallet.
- **Pre-filled transaction details**: No need to copy/paste, scan QR codes, or toggle apps.
- **Conversion-optimized UX**: Fewer steps = more completed payments.

Perfect for merchants and payment providers who want to **maximize conversions** and offer a **modern checkout experience** that rivals Web2.

***One click. One user journey. Zero friction.***

<Note>
    This feature is currently in early access and is about to launch soon.     Wallets will need to support `wallet_checkout` method for this feature to work as expected. 
    
    We recommend checking with us to ensure that target wallet providers support the necessary functionality. If you are interested in getting early access or learning more, please reach out to us at sales@reown.com.
