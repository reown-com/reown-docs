**Reown** is building the payment connective layer for the financial internet, unlocking stablecoin-native flows for any token source: wallets, exchanges or fiat.

Today’s payment stack is fragmented. **Reown aims to tie it together**. With one integration using our SDK, platforms can accept value from wherever users hold it and turn it into deposits, purchases, or investments.

This is **only possible through WalletConnect**, the connective layer that lets any wallet, on any chain, connect to any platform, securely and at scale. Reown transforms this universal access into universal payment rails; powering seamless, secure and globally compliant payments

These solutions provided by Reown give providers access to hundreds of millions of users via 600+ wallets and multiple exchanges, with support for EVM, Bitcoin, and Solana.

## Current Problems with Payments

**Users hold value everywhere but businesses are stuck building for each source in isolation.**

1. **Fragmented token sources**: Wallets, exchanges, and fiat on-ramps all require separate payment flows.
2. **UX friction**: Copy-pasting, KYC loops, and gas confusion kill conversion, especially on mobile.
3. **Feature silos**: Staking, deposits, and investments need distinct integrations, slowing time-to-market.

**As a result, companies either build wallet-only flows or maintain costly parallel stacks. A unifying rail across all capital source is missing.**

## How Reown Solves These Problems

Reown powers modern payment experiences like:

1. **Pay with Self Custodial Wallet**: Let users pay with their self custodial wallets like MetaMask, Trust, Ledger, and more. This flow is bundled together with the **Pay with Exchange** flow.

2. **Pay with Exchange**: Let users pay directly from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and more.

3. **1-Click Checkout**: Fast, mobile-optimized, self-custodial and crypto native checkout flows (coming soon).

3. **Subscriptions & Recurring Payments**: Enable recurring payments and subscriptions with onchain with the best UX practices.

***One integration. Infinite reach. Real crypto payments, done right.***
