title: Deposit with Exchange
description: Let users seamlessly fund their connected wallets directly from their exchange accounts or another wallet.
---

**Deposit with Exchange** gives your users a seamless way to fund their connected wallets directly from centralized exchange accounts like **Coinbase** and **Binance** (with more exchanges coming soon).
Instead of forcing users to leave your app, log into their exchange, and manually handle withdrawals, you can offer a guided in-app flow that keeps them engaged and ready to transact.

<Warning>
  Coinbase has recently updated their compliance requirements. Deposit with Exchange remains compliant,  but partners need to provide their own Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) API keys. More information can be found in the respective [quickstart guides](#get-started).
</Warning>

## Why Deposit with Exchange?

- **Instant access to existing funds:** No need for fiat payments, KYC, or new providers. Users move crypto they already own.
- **Frictionless experience:** Just a few clicks to deposit directly from an exchange into their wallet.
- **Perpetually available:** Reown establishes direct agreements with partner exchanges to ensure perpetual availability.
- **Security-first:** All activity flows directly through the exchange - no third-party access at any point.
- **Full customization:** Deposit with Exchange is provided through a headless SDK to ensure flexibility for you and your users.
- **Boost activation and retention:** A smoother onboarding and funding flow leads to better conversion, more repeat usage, less drop-offs.

<Note>
**Onramp.money, Rootstock Collective, Bitgpt.xyz**, and a dozen other teams use the Pay/Deposit with Exchange feature already.
</Note>


## How does it work?

1. User connects a wallet through Reown AppKit.
2. After user realizes that their wallet is short on funds, the user selects "Transfer or Deposit with Exchange" as the funding method.
3. User chooses an exchange account and token.
4. User completes the deposit/transfer flow via the CEX's authorization.
5. The funds appear in the connected wallet and the user can proceed with their intended action.
