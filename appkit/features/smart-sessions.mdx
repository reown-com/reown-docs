Smart Sessions is a feature in Reown AppKit that allows users to grant decentralized applications (dApps) permission to perform specific blockchain actions on their behalf for a defined period of time. This eliminates the need for users to manually approve each transaction, enhancing the user experience by enabling seamless and automated interactions.

<Note>
Smart Sessions is currently an early access feature.

## When can you leverage Smart Sessions?

1. **Uninterrupted User Experience**: Users can authorize transactions to occur in the background, reducing friction and enhancing engagement, especially in contexts like gaming or decentralized finance (DeFi). 

2. **Enhanced Automation**: Web3 apps can automate routine tasks such as token swaps, staking, or loan repayments without requiring user intervention for each action. 

3. **Flexible Permissions**: Users can specify which functions a dApp is allowed to execute, the duration of the permissions, and other conditions, providing fine-grained control over delegated actions.

## How It Works

- **Permission Granting**: The user connects their wallet (e.g., via email) and grants the dApp permission to perform certain actions by approving a grantPermissions request. 

- **Server Interaction**: The dApp's backend server can then execute the authorized functions on behalf of the user by signing transactions using a predefined key pair. 

- **Transaction Execution**: The server prepares and sends the transactions to the blockchain, and can monitor their status to confirm successful execution. 

## Example Use Cases
- **Recurring Payments**: Automate subscription renewals without requiring user approval each time.

- **Automated Trading**: Set up limit orders or dollar-cost averaging strategies that execute based on predefined conditions.

- **In-Game Transactions**: Allow games to perform actions like purchasing items or allocating resources without interrupting gameplay. 

- **Power crypto subscriptions** - approve once, charge monthly.
- **Let gamers stake, trade, or level up** without wallet popups.
- **Automate cross-chain workflows** like swaps, staking, or purchases.

## Supported Networks
