Add custom connectors for Wagmi

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Wagmi">

If you already have Wagmi integrated into your application or would like more control over Wagmi's configuration, you can integrate AppKit on top of it.

Adding custom connectors like WalletConnect and Coinbase is optional.

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

```tsx
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'

import { http, WagmiProvider, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
import { abstractTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
// you need to add the abstract library in order to make it work
import { abstractWalletConnector } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react/connectors";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID

const metadata = {
  //...
}

// create the custom connector (in this example Abastract)
const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = []
connectors.push(abstractWalletConnector())

export const networks = [abstractTestnet]

export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  connectors,
  projectId,
  networks
})

export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig

createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks
})

export function ContextProvider({ children }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
```

</Tab>
