title: Sending with Dashboard
---

You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](./cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in several places including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com), in your app with our [frontend SDK](./frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com) under the Notify API section:

1. In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.
