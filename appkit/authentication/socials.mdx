## Ensuring the Security of Your Private Key

The SDK uses [Magic](https://magic.link/) to provide Universal Wallets. For information on how these are created and how the **Private Keys** are managed, refer to Magic's docs [here](https://magic.link/docs/home/security/product-security#patented-key-management).
