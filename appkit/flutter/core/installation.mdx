With AppKit Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Let's get started with the installation and configuration!

## Installation

<Note>
If you are just starting a new project, you can use our [CLI tool](https://pub.dev/packages/reown_cli) to get started quickly.
</Note>

1.  - Add `reown_appkit` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` (check out the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/reown_appkit/install))
    - Or simply run `flutter pub add reown_appkit`
2.  - Locate your `/ios/Podfile` file and add the following as the first line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

3.  - Run `$ pod install` inside the `/ios` folder.
4.  - You should now be able to run your app with `flutter run --dart-define=PROJECT_ID={your_project_id}`

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect installed wallets on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native sides of the project.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>safe</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
</array>
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add your `<queries>...</queries>` schemes outside of `<application />` scope.
3. Refer to [Android Specs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/queries-element) for more information.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="io.metamask"/>
        <package android:name="com.wallet.crypto.trustapp"/>
        <package android:name="io.gnosis.safe"/>
        <package android:name="me.rainbow"/>
        <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Coinbase Wallet support

Coinbase Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Coinbase Wallet.

However, you can still enable it to seamlessly connect with your dApp with these additional steps.

If you still want to support it, on your iOS and Android native side make the following changes:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>cbwallet</string>
  <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
</array>
```

4. Make sure pods are installed, otherwise run `pod install` inside your `/ios` folder.
5. Open your `/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and add the following code in `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import CoinbaseWalletSDK
```

```swift
override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}

override func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if let url = userActivity.webpageURL,
            (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(application, continue: userActivity, restorationHandler: restorationHandler)
}
```

Check out the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) file from our sample dapp for reference.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add `<package android:name="org.toshi"/>` scheme inside `<queries>...</queries>` as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="org.toshi"/>
        <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Disable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet is enabled by default even though, in order to function properly, a few steps have to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don't want to include/support Coinbase Wallet in your app you just need to pass Coinbase Wallet id `fd20dc426fb37566d803205b19bbc1d4096b248ac04548e3cfb6b3a38bd033aa` to [excludedWalletIds](./options#excludedwalletids) options Array.

<hr />

### Phantom Wallet support

<Note>
Phantom Wallet support is available from `reown_appkit: ^1.4.0`.
</Note>

Phantom Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet, instead it provides an internal API mechanism based on deep/universal links.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Phantom Wallet and the interaction is really basic. Dapp sends a request, Phantom Wallet responds. That's all.

Furthermore, Phantom Wallet's deep/universal linking mechanism supports interaction exclusively with the Solana network. This means that if you have EVM networks configured in your AppKit instance, they will not be available for use after connecting with Phantom.

In order to support Phantom Wallet interactions, a few extra steps have to be performed (only if you haven't implemented [Link Mode](./link-mode) already).

1. First, be sure you already have your redirection back property configured in your dApp's metadata. See [Redirect to your dApp](./usage#redirect-to-your-dapp)
2. Then you will have to implement your own Deep Link mechanism on the Flutter (and native) side so that when a link is received through it, you can just call `await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);`

As guidance, here you can see how it's done in our sample dApp:

#### First, enable Phantom Wallet detection

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Include `<string>phantom</string>` scheme

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>phantom</string>
  <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
</array>
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add `<package android:name="app.phantom"/>` scheme inside `<queries>...</queries>` as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="app.phantom"/>
        <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Then, on Flutter side we create an `EventChannel` where links are going to be received and passed to `dispatchEnvelope()`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Flutter">
```javascript
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:reown_appkit/modal/i_appkit_modal_impl.dart';

class DeepLinkHandler {
  static const _eventChannel = EventChannel('com.exampledapp/events');
  static late IReownAppKitModal _appKitModal;

  static void init(IReownAppKitModal appKitModal) {
    if (kIsWeb) return;

    try {
      _appKitModal = appKitModal;
      _eventChannel.receiveBroadcastStream().listen(_onLink, onError: _onError);
    } catch (e) {
      debugPrint('[SampleDapp] checkInitialLink $e');
    }
  }

  static void _onLink(dynamic link) async {
    try {
      _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);
    } catch (e) {
      print(e);
    }
  }

  static void _onError(dynamic error) {
    print(error);
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Then, on both native sides we leverage native APIs to capture the app opening link and send it to Flutter side.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">
```swift
import Flutter
import UIKit

@main
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  private static let EVENTS_CHANNEL = "com.exampledapp/events"
  private var eventsChannel: FlutterEventChannel?
  private let linkStreamHandler = LinkStreamHandler()

  override func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)

    let controller = window.rootViewController as! FlutterViewController
    eventsChannel = FlutterEventChannel(name: AppDelegate.EVENTS_CHANNEL, binaryMessenger: controller.binaryMessenger)
    eventsChannel?.setStreamHandler(linkStreamHandler)

    if let userActivityDictionary = launchOptions?[.userActivityDictionary] as? [String: Any],
      let userActivity = userActivityDictionary["UIApplicationLaunchOptionsUserActivityKey"] as? NSUserActivity,
      userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb {

      handleIncomingUniversalLink(userActivity: userActivity)
    }

    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }

  override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return linkStreamHandler.handleLink(url.absoluteString)
  }

  override func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb {
      handleIncomingUniversalLink(userActivity: userActivity)
      return true
    }

    return false
  }

  private func handleIncomingUniversalLink(userActivity: NSUserActivity) {
    if let url = userActivity.webpageURL {
      print("App launched with Universal Link: \(url.absoluteString)")
      let _ = linkStreamHandler.handleLink(url.absoluteString)
    }
  }
}

class LinkStreamHandler: NSObject, FlutterStreamHandler {
  var eventSink: FlutterEventSink?
  var queuedLinks = [String]()

  func onListen(withArguments arguments: Any?, eventSink events: @escaping FlutterEventSink) -> FlutterError? {
    self.eventSink = events
    queuedLinks.forEach({ events($0) })
    queuedLinks.removeAll()
    return nil
  }

  func onCancel(withArguments arguments: Any?) -> FlutterError? {
    self.eventSink = nil
    return nil
  }

  func handleLink(_ link: String) -> Bool {
    guard let eventSink = eventSink else {
      queuedLinks.append(link)
      return false

    eventSink(link)

### Solflare Wallet support

<Note>
Solflare Wallet support is available from `reown_appkit: ^1.6.0`.
</Note>

Similar to Phantom Wallet, Solflare does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet, instead it provides an internal API mechanism based on deep/universal links.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Solflare Wallet and the interaction is really basic. Dapp sends a request, Solflare Wallet responds. That's all.

Furthermore, Solflare Wallet's deep/universal linking mechanism supports interaction exclusively with the Solana network. This means that if you have EVM networks configured in your AppKit instance, they will not be available for use after connecting with Solflare.

In order to support Solflare Wallet interactions, a few extra steps have to be performed (only if you haven't implemented [Link Mode](./link-mode) already).

1. First, be sure you already have your redirection back property configured in your dApp's metadata. See [Redirect to your dApp](./usage#redirect-to-your-dapp)
2. Then you will have to implement your own Deep Link mechanism on the Flutter (and native) side so that when a link is received through it, you can just call `await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);`

As guidance, here you can see how it's done in our sample dApp:

#### First, enable Solflare Wallet detection

<Tabs>
<Tab title="iOS">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Include `<string>solflare</string>` scheme

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>solflare</string>
  <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
</array>
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add `<package android:name="com.solflare.mobile"/>` scheme inside `<queries>...</queries>` as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="com.solflare.mobile"/>
        <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The rest of the configuration is identical to Phantom's configuration.

#### Disable Solflare Wallet

Solflare Wallet is enabled by default even though, in order to function properly, a few steps have to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don't want to include/support Solflare Wallet in your app you just need to pass Solflare Wallet id `1ca0bdd4747578705b1939af023d120677c64fe6ca76add81fda36e350605e79` to [excludedWalletIds](./options#excludedwalletids) options Array.
