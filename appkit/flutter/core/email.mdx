title: Email & Social Wallets
---

AppKit enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails or social accounts.

## Integration

In order to support Email and Social Wallets creation just set `featuresConfig:` parameter in `ReownAppKitModal` initialization.

```javascript {14-27}
final _appKitModal = ReownAppKitModal(
  context: context,
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Example App',
    description: 'Example app description',
    url: 'https://example.com/',
    icons: ['https://example.com/logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'exampleapp://',
      universal: 'https://reown.com/exampleapp',
    ),
  ),
  featuresConfig: FeaturesConfig(
    socials: [
      AppKitSocialOption.Email,
      AppKitSocialOption.X,
      AppKitSocialOption.Google,
      AppKitSocialOption.Apple,
      AppKitSocialOption.Discord,
      AppKitSocialOption.GitHub,
      AppKitSocialOption.Facebook,
      AppKitSocialOption.Twitch,
      AppKitSocialOption.Telegram,
    ],
    showMainWallets: false, // OPTIONAL - true by default
  ),
);
```

## Options

- **_socials `List<AppKitSocialOption>`_** : This list contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. Is empty by default, it means that no social options is enabled. The buttons in the modal will be shown in the same order you configure the list.
- **_showMainWallets `bool`_** : This boolean defines whether you want to show the main wallet options on the first connect screen. If this is `false` it will show a button that directs you to a new screen displaying all available wallets. Default `true`.

<Info>
In order for Farcaster to work properly, either `AppKitModalConnectButton()` or `AppKitModalAccountButton()` has to be instantiated during the whole lifetime of the app.

If you already use them then nothing else has to be done, but in case you don't use them but still want to support Email & Social Wallets you would have to instantiate and hide them as follows:

```javascript
AppKitModalConnectButton(
  appKit: _appKitModal,
  custom: SizedBox.shrink(), // Will make the button invisible
),
AppKitModalAccountButton(
  appKit: _appKitModal,
  custom: SizedBox.shrink(), // Will make the button invisible
),
```
</Info>

## User Flow

1.	Users can connect to your application using either an email address or a social login option. Upon selecting an option, they will be redirected to a secure login page in the device’s default browser. If the Email option is selected, AppKit will first send an approval link to the user's email, followed by a One-Time Password (OTP) to be used in the login flow. This process helps verify the user’s identity. In both cases, whether using Email or Social login, a non-custodial wallet will be created for the user. This wallet will be accessible across any application that integrates AppKit and Email Wallets.

2.	Eventually, users can optionally choose to upgrade from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by tapping “Upgrade Wallet” in AppKit. This action opens the Reown secure website, which guides the user through the upgrade process.
