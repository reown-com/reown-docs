This FAQ section covers common questions and solutions for using AppKit. The questions are organized into three main categories:

- **Configuration**: Questions about setting up AppKit, including project configuration, wallet visibility, and RPC customization.
- **Features**: Information about AppKit's capabilities, including off-ramp support, multi-wallet address retrieval, and branding options.
- **Technical**: Technical details about project approval requirements and initialization constraints.

## AppKit Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing an 'Invalid App Configuration' error?">
    <img src="/images/faq/invalidAppConfiguration.png" />

    This error typically occurs when the `projectId` is not configured correctly. To resolve this:

    1. Create a valid project ID at [https://dashboard.reown.com/](https://dashboard.reown.com/)
    2. Add it to your AppKit configuration:

    ```javascript
    const modal = createAppKit({
      ...
      projectId: "..." // Add your valid projectId here
    });
    ```
    3. Ensure that you have added your domain to the allowed domains in your project settings. If you have not done so, you can do so by navigating to **"Project Domains"** on the Dashboard, clicking on **"Configure Domains"** and adding your domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see any wallets in the modal and only see the 'Connect Wallet' title?">
    **Problem**: Users only see the "Connect Wallet" title in the modal after clicking the connect button.

    **Solution**: This issue typically has two possible causes:

    1. **Version Mismatch**: Ensure all @reown libraries use the same version in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@reown/appkit": "1.7.8",
        "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi": "1.7.8"
        // ... other dependencies
      }
    }
    ```

    2. **Initialization Location**: Call `createAppKit` outside of your component to ensure proper initialization:

    ```javascript
    // Create modal
    createAppKit({
      adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
      ...generalConfig,
      features: {
        analytics: true // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
      }
    })

    export function App() {
      return (
        <WagmiProvider ...>
          <QueryClientProvider ...>
            <appkit-button />
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I use custom RPCs with AppKit?">
    You can use your own RPC by setting the `customRpcUrls` option in the AppKit configuration. This lets you define custom RPC URLs for specific chains. Each entry must follow the format:

    ```javascript
    customRpcUrls: {
      [ChainId.Ethereum]: 'https://your.custom.rpc.url',
      [ChainId.Polygon]: 'https://your.polygon.rpc.url'
    }
    ```

    AppKit will prioritize these URLs over the default ones.

## Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When will Reown support off-ramp functionality?">
    Reown currently does not plan to support off-ramp functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get retrieve multiple addresses from multiple connected wallets?">
    To retrieve addresses from multiple connected wallets, refer to our multichain example:

    - [Live Demo](https://appkit-web-examples-react-multichain.reown.com/)
    - [Source Code](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-multichain)

    Example using React SDK:

    ```javascript
    import { useAppKitAccount } from '@reown/appkit/react'

    // Get account states for different chains
    const eip155AccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'eip155' })
    const solanaAccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'solana' })
    ```

    ```javascript
    <>
      EVM Address: {eip155AccountState.address}<br />
      Solana Address: {solanaAccountState.address}<br />
    </>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove the 'UX by Reown' branding?">
    Currently, only enterprise clients can hide "UX by Reown" on the AppKit modal by adjusting this option on our Dashboard. If you are an enterprise client and would like to hide this branding, please contact sales@reown.com.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I increase my project's RPC limits?">
    Reown currently provides 2.5 million requests per 30 days. If you wish to increase this limit, you need to upgrade to AppKit Pro.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to wait for Web3 app approval before using my projectId?">
    No, dApps do not need approval in order to use your projectId.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reinitialize AppKit with different network configurations?">
    Currently, `createAppKit` can only be called once during the application's lifecycle. 
    It cannot be lazily initialized and then torn down for re-initialization. 
    This means you must pass in all the networks you plan to support during the initial setup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get technical support for AppKit?">
    Free tier AppKit customers only are only entitled to support via [Discord](https://discord.gg/reown). Please join the Discord server and create a forum post **#developers-forum** and the team will get back to you.

    AppKit Pro and Enterprise customers get priority support via dedicated channels.
