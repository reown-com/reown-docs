This FAQ section covers common questions and solutions for using Reown. The questions are organized into three main categories:

- **Configuration**: Questions about setting up Reown, including project configuration, wallet visibility, and RPC customization.
- **Features**: Information about Reown's capabilities, including off-ramp support, multi-wallet address retrieval, and branding options.
- **Technical**: Technical details about project approval requirements and initialization constraints.

## Reown Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing an 'Invalid App Configuration' error?">
    <img src="/images/faq/invalidAppConfiguration.png" />

    This error typically occurs when the `projectId` is not configured correctly. To resolve this:

    1. Create a valid project ID at [https://dashboard.reown.com/](https://dashboard.reown.com/)
    2. Add it to your Reown configuration:

    ```javascript
    const modal = createAppKit({
      ...
      projectId: "..." // Add your valid projectId here
    });
    ```
    3. Ensure that you have added your domain to the allowed domains in your project settings. If you have not done so, you can do so by navigating to **"Project Domains"** on the Dashboard, clicking on **"Configure Domains"** and adding your domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are the 'Connect wallet' and 'Network' buttons greyed out?">
    This can happen if your device is unable to reach the [WalletConnect relay service](https://relay.walletconnect.org).

    If you see an error like:

    ```bash
    SocketException: Failed host lookup: 'relay.walletconnect.org' (OS Error: No address associated with hostname, errno = 7)
    ```
    It usually means your connection is blocked by your VPN or network.

    ### Common causes and steps to resolve:

    1. **VPN or Firewall settings**
      - Some VPNs may block access to the relay service.
      - If you are using a VPN (e.g., Windscribe), try:
        - Switching the VPN protocol to **WStunnel**.
        - Turning **off the Firewall toggle** in your VPN settings.

    2. **Network restrictions**
      - If you’re on a restricted network (e.g., public Wi-Fi, corporate network, or in a restricted country), the relay service may be blocked.
      - Try switching to a different ISP or network.

    3. **Connectivity issues**
      - Confirm that you can reach `relay.walletconnect.org`.  
      - A 100% packet loss when pinging may indicate the service is blocked on your network.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see any wallets in the modal and only see the 'Connect Wallet' title?">
    **Problem**: Users only see the "Connect Wallet" title in the modal after clicking the connect button.

    **Solution**: This issue typically has two possible causes:

    1. **Version Mismatch**: Ensure all @reown libraries use the same version in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@reown/appkit": "1.7.8",
        "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi": "1.7.8"
        // ... other dependencies
      }
    }
    ```

    2. **Initialization Location**: Call `createAppKit` outside of your component to ensure proper initialization:

    ```javascript
    // Create modal
    createAppKit({
      adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
      ...generalConfig,
      features: {
        analytics: true // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
      }
    })

    export function App() {
      return (
        <WagmiProvider ...>
          <QueryClientProvider ...>
            <appkit-button />
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I use custom RPCs with Reown?">
    You can use your own RPC by setting the `customRpcUrls` option in the Reown configuration. This lets you define custom RPC URLs for specific chains. Each entry must follow the format:

    ```javascript
    customRpcUrls: {
      [ChainId.Ethereum]: 'https://your.custom.rpc.url',
      [ChainId.Polygon]: 'https://your.polygon.rpc.url'
    }
    ```

    Reown will prioritize these URLs over the default ones.

## Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When will Reown support off-ramp functionality?">
    Reown currently does not plan to support off-ramp functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get retrieve multiple addresses from multiple connected wallets?">
    To retrieve addresses from multiple connected wallets, refer to our multichain example:

    - [Live Demo](https://appkit-web-examples-react-multichain.reown.com/)
    - [Source Code](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-multichain)

    Example using React SDK:

    ```javascript
    import { useAppKitAccount } from '@reown/appkit/react'

    // Get account states for different chains
    const eip155AccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'eip155' })
    const solanaAccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'solana' })
    ```

    ```javascript
    <>
      EVM Address: {eip155AccountState.address}<br />
      Solana Address: {solanaAccountState.address}<br />
    </>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove the 'UX by Reown' branding?">
    Currently, only enterprise clients can hide "UX by Reown" on the Reown modal by adjusting this option on our Dashboard. If you are an enterprise client and would like to hide this branding, contact us [via our form here](https://share.hsforms.com/1_oWa8QkwRXi6oR0nZ_SIxQnxw6s).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I increase my project's RPC limits?">
    Reown currently provides 2.5 million requests per 30 days. If you wish to increase this limit, you need to upgrade to Reown Pro.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to wait for Web3 app approval before using my projectId?">
    No, dApps do not need approval in order to use your projectId.
    
    Additionally, you do not need to whitelist IP addresses when using Reown. Reown is a client-side SDK, so all requests are made directly from the user's browser or device, not from your servers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are signatures longer in some cases?">
    Signatures can appear longer when using non-deployed smart accounts. These accounts include extra data in the signature to handle deployment and verification. Once the account is deployed, the signatures return to their normal size.
    This happens when you connect with a social login but haven’t made a transaction yet. Before the first transaction, the smart account isn’t deployed, so the signature includes extra data for deployment and verification. After the first transaction, the account is deployed and signatures go back to normal size.

    You can always use [viem's verifyMessage](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/verifyMessage) to verify the signature in different formats.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I add my web wallet to the wallet list in WalletConnect?">
    Add your web wallet to WalletConnect by following the steps in this link: https://docs.reown.com/cloud/explorer-submission.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reinitialize Reown with different network configurations?">
    Currently, `createAppKit` can only be called once during the application's lifecycle. 
    It cannot be lazily initialized and then torn down for re-initialization. 
    This means you must pass in all the networks you plan to support during the initial setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I open wallet apps from in-app browsers on Android?">
    When users access a dApp from within an in-app browser (such as Telegram, Discord, or other apps with embedded browsers) on Android, they may be unable to open external wallet apps like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. This is a known platform limitation on Android where in-app browsers restrict the ability to launch external applications via deep links.

    ### Why this happens

    Android in-app browsers (WebViews) are sandboxed environments that, by default, do not allow navigation to custom URL schemes or intent URLs that would open external apps. This is a security measure implemented at the operating system level and is not something that can be resolved by Reown or the dApp itself.

    ### Workarounds for users

    1. **Open in external browser**: Most in-app browsers have an option to open the current page in the device's default browser (usually accessible via a menu or "Open in Browser" button). From the external browser, wallet deep links will work as expected.

    2. **Copy the link and paste in browser**: Users can copy the dApp URL and paste it into their preferred mobile browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

    3. **Use QR code scanning**: If the user has their wallet app open, they can use the wallet's built-in QR code scanner to scan the WalletConnect QR code displayed in the Reown modal, which bypasses the need for deep linking entirely.

    4. **Use the wallet's built-in browser**: Many wallet apps (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) have their own built-in dApp browsers. Users can navigate to the dApp directly within their wallet app for a seamless experience.

    ### For app developers embedding WebViews

    If you are building an app that embeds a WebView and want to support wallet connections, you need to explicitly handle deep links in your WebView implementation. See our [troubleshooting guide](/appkit/recipes/troubleshooting#in-app-browser-deeplink-detection) for code examples on how to intercept and handle wallet deep links across different platforms.
