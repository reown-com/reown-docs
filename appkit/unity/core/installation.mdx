## Install

Let's get started by installing the Reown package!

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2022.3 or above
- IL2CPP code stripping level: Minimal (or lower)

  - If you need Linear color space, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-dotnet/issues)

### Reown Package

<Tabs>
<Tab title="OpenUPM CLI">

To install Reown package via OpenUPM, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [openupm-cli](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli) installed. Once you have them installed, you can run the following commands:

```bash
openupm add com.reown.appkit.unity
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Package Manager with OpenUPM">

1. Open `Advanced Project Settings` from the gear ⚙ menu located at the top right of the Package Manager’s toolbar
2. Add a new scoped registry with the following details:
   - Name: `OpenUPM`
   - URL: `https://package.openupm.com`
   - Scope(s): `com.reown` and `com.nethereum`
3. Press plus ➕ and then `Save` buttons
4. In the Package Manager windows open the add ➕ menu from the toolbar
5. Select `Add package by name...`
6. Enter the names of the following packages one by one:
   - `com.nethereum.unity`
   - `com.reown.core`
   - `com.reown.core.crypto`
   - `com.reown.core.common`
   - `com.reown.core.network`
   - `com.reown.core.storage`
   - `com.reown.sign`
   - `com.reown.sign.unity`
   - `com.reown.sign.nethereum`
   - `com.reown.sign.nethereum.unity`
   - `com.reown.appkit.unity`
   - `com.reown.unity.dependencies`
7. Press `Add` button

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  If you encounter errors related to the `com.unity.vectorgraphics` package after installing Reown,
  please install it manually from the Package Manager. Click the plus ➕ button in the Package
  Manager window, then select the `Add package by name...` option and enter
  `com.unity.vectorgraphics`.
</Note>

## Configure

The minimum configuration required is filling in a `Project ID` and `Metadata` fields inside of `AppKitConfig`.

<CloudBanner />

```csharp
await AppKit.InitializeAsync(
    new AppKitConfig(
        projectId: "YOUR PROJECT ID",
        new Metadata(
            name: "My Game",
            description: "Short description
            url: "https://example.com",
            iconUrl: "https://example.com/logo.png"
        )
    )
);
```

- **projectId**: The project ID is a unique identifier for your project.
  - If you don't have a Project ID, you can create one at [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com).).
- **name**: The project name is a human-readable name for your project.
- **description**: The project description is a human-readable description for your project.
- **url**: The project URL
- **iconUrl**: Icon of the project.

## Implement

1. Add `Reown AppKit` prefab from `Packages/Reown.AppKit.Unity/Prefabs` to your scene.
2. Initialize Reown from your script

```csharp
public async void Start()
{
    var config = new AppKitConfig(...);
    await AppKit.InitializeAsync(config);
}
```

3. Connect account

```csharp
public async Task ResumeSession()
{
    // Try to resume account connection from the last session
    var resumed = await AppKit.ConnectorController.TryResumeSessionAsync();

    if (resumed)
    {
        // Continue to the game
        MyAccountConnectedHandler();
    }
    else
    {
        // Connect account
        AppKit.AccountConnected += (_, e) => MyAccountConnectedHandler();
        AppKit.OpenModal();
    }
}
```

> Optional: Using Solana Unity SDK? You can keep using `Solana.Unity.SDK`'s `Web3` and route all signing through Reown with our adapter. See the adapter section in [Usage](/appkit/unity/core/usage#appkit-with-solana-unity-sdk).
