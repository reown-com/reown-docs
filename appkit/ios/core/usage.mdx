### Configure Networking and Pair clients

Make sure that you properly configure Networking and Pair Clients first.

- [Networking](/advanced/api/core/relay)

### Initialize AppKit Client

In order to initialize a client just call a `configure` method from the AppKit instance wrapper

```swift
let metadata = AppMetadata(
    name: "Example Wallet",
    description: "Wallet description",
    url: "example.wallet",
    icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179229932"],
    // Used for the Verify: to opt-out verification ignore this parameter
    verifyUrl: "verify.walletconnect.com"
)

AppKit.configure(
    projectId: PROJECT_ID,
    metadata: metadata
)
```

<CloudBanner />

This example will default to using following namespaces.

```swift
let methods: Set<String> = ["eth_sendTransaction", "personal_sign", "eth_signTypedData"]
let events: Set<String> = ["chainChanged", "accountsChanged"]
let blockchains: Set<Blockchain> = [Blockchain("eip155:1")!]
let namespaces: [String: ProposalNamespace] = [
    "eip155": ProposalNamespace(
        chains: blockchains,
        methods: methods,
        events: events
    )
]

let defaultSessionParams =  SessionParams(
                                namespaces: namespaces,
                                sessionProperties: nil
                            )
```

If you want to change that you can call configure and define your own session parameters like this.

```swift
let metadata = AppMetadata(...)

let sessionParams = SessionParams(...)

AppKit.configure(
    projectId: PROJECT_ID,
    metadata: metadata,
    sessionParams: sessionParams
)
```

or you can change them later by calling `AppKit.set(sessionParams: SessionParams(...))`

### Provided UI components

Now you can use the `AppKitButton` or `AppKitNetworkButton` components. These two components reflect the state of the AppKit client,
including the session state, account address and balance, currently selected network, and will automatically update when the state changes.
More can be found in https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Sample/Example/ContentView.swift as part of the Sample app.

### Custom UI

If you want to use custom UI you can present the modal by simply calling.

```swift
AppKit.present()
```

It will traverse the view hierarchy and try to present from top most controller. This is meant more towards SwiftUI.

Otherwise you can specify the viewController to present from.

```swift
AppKit.present(from: viewController)
```

### Subscribe for AppKit Publishers

The following publishers are available to subscribe:

```swift
public var sessionPublisher: AnyPublisher<[Session], Never>
public var sessionSettlePublisher: AnyPublisher<Session, Never>
public var sessionRejectionPublisher: AnyPublisher<(Session.Proposal, Reason), Never>
public var sessionDeletePublisher: AnyPublisher<(String, Reason), Never>
public var sessionResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<Response, Never>
public var socketConnectionStatusPublisher: AnyPublisher<SocketConnectionStatus, Never>
public var authResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<(id: RPCID, result: Result<(Session?, [Cacao]), AuthError>), Never>
```

### Sign methods

AppKit is internally using Sign SDK and most of its method are being exposed through AppKit interface.

### Where to go from here
