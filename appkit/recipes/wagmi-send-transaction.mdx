## AppKit Minimal Installation

You can start a small project following the guidelines from our [installation React docs using Wagmi](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation?platform=wagmi)

## Start building

In this guide we are going to use the library [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to make the calls to the blockchain and to interact with the wallet.

### Get Balance

Fetching a user's balance is straightforward using the `useBalance` hook from wagmi.

1. Start by importing the useBalance hook, the AppKit hook to get the account information and the Address type.

```jsx
import { useBalance } from "wagmi";
import { useAppKitAccount } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import { type Address } from "viem";
```

2. Use the `useAppKitAccount` hook to retrieve the user's address and check if they are connected. Also call the `useBalance` hook.

```jsx
// AppKit hook to get the address and check if the user is connected
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount()

// Call the useBalance hook with the user's address to prepare for fetching the balance.
const { refetch } = useBalance({
    address: address as Address
});

```

3. Create a function to fetch and display (in console) the balance when triggered

```jsx
// function to get the balance
const handleGetBalance = async () => {
  const balance = await refetch();
  console.log(
    `${balance?.data?.value.toString()} ${balance?.data?.symbol.toString()}`
  );
};
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function you can show the button in a component when `isConnected` is `true`

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={getBalance}>Get Balance</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

### Sign a message

In order to raise the modal to sign a message with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing the `useSignMessage` hook.

```jsx
import { useSignMessage } from "wagmi";
```

2. Extract the `signMessageAsync` function from the `useSignMessage` hook. This function allows you to prompt the connected wallet to sign a specific message. Also get the address and isConnected as explain before.

```jsx
// Wagmi hook to sign a message
const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage();

// AppKit hook to get the address and check if the user is connected
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount();
```

3. Generate the function to raise the modal to sign the message

```jsx
// function to sing a msg
const handleSignMsg = async () => {
    // message to sign
    const msg = "Hello Reown AppKit!"
    const sig = await signMessageAsync({ message: msg, account: address as Address });
}
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSignMsg}>Sign Message</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

### Send a transaction in EVM

In order to raise the modal to sign and send a transaction with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing `useEstimateGas` and `useSendTransaction` hooks.

```jsx
import { useEstimateGas, useSendTransaction } from "wagmi";
import { parseGwei, type Address } from "viem";
```

2. Use the `useEstimateGas` hook to calculate the gas required for the transaction, then proceed to send the transaction and get the user's connection status with the provided hooks.

```jsx

// test transaction
const TEST_TX = {
  to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045" as Address, // vitalik address
  value: parseGwei('0.0001')
}

 // Wagmi hook to estimate gas
const { data: gas } = useEstimateGas({...TEST_TX});

// Wagmi hook to send a transaction
const { data: hash, sendTransaction, } = useSendTransaction();

// AppKit hook to check if the user is connected
const { isConnected } = useAppKitAccount()
```

3. Generate the function to raise the modal to send the transaction

```jsx
// function to send a TX
const handleSendTx = () => {
  try {
    sendTransaction({
      ...TEST_TX,
      gas, // Add the gas to the transaction
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error sending transaction:", err);
  }
};
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSendTx}>Send Transaction</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```
