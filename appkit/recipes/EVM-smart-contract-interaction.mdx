In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Read data from a smart contract
- Write data to a smart contract

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

- A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
- A minimal installation of AppKit in React.
- Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud Dashboard at https://dashboard.reown.com

## Try the demo in Sepolia Testnet

- [Wagmi Example](https://appkit-web-examples-react-wagmi.reown.com/)

## Requirements

In order to interact with a smart contract you will need to have one deployed in a EVM-compatible blockchain. There are several tools to help you deploy a smart contract:

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

We have already deployed a simple smart contract (0xEe6D291CC60d7CeD6627fA4cd8506912245c8cA4) in Sepolia Testnet for you to use. Once you compile the smart contract, you get the ABI.
The ABI is a set of rules that define how the contract's functions can be called and how data is sent and received.

To interact with the smart contract, you need to have some tokens to pay for gas fees when writing to the contract. You can get them from this [faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia), but you can also look for other options on the web.
It's also good to know that reading from a smart contract is free.

For both SDKs, you need to declare the contract address and ABI.

```jsx
const storageSC = "0xEe6D291CC60d7CeD6627fA4cd8506912245c8cA4";

const storageABI = [
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "retrieve",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "num",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    name: "store",
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    type: "function",
  },
];
```

### Start building with Wagmi

1. Start by importing the hooks to read and write.

```jsx
import { useReadContract, useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
```

2. Call the hooks.

```jsx
const { writeContract, isSuccess } = useWriteContract();
const readContract = useReadContract({
  address: storageSC,
  abi: storageABI,
  functionName: "retrieve",
  query: {
    enabled: false, // disable the query in onload
  },
});
```

3. Generate the actions:

```jsx
// Call the function to read the smart contract and print on console
const handleReadSmartContract = async () => {
  const { data } = await readContract.refetch();
  console.log("data: ", data);
};

// Write to the smart contract and check if the transaction is successful with useEffect
const handleWriteSmartContract = () => {
  writeContract({
    address: storageSC,
    abi: storageABI,
    functionName: "store",
    args: [123n],
  });
};

// useEffect to print the success message when the contract is written
useEffect(() => {
  if (isSuccess) {
    console.log("contract write success");
  }
}, [isSuccess]);
```

### Start building with Ethers

1. Start by importing the libraries needed to interact:

```jsx
import { useAppKitProvider } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import { Contract, BrowserProvider } from "ethers";
import type { Provider } from "@reown/appkit/react";
```

2. Call the AppKit Provider hook:

```jsx
const { walletProvider } = useAppKitProvider<Provider>("eip155");
```

3. Generate the actions calling the functions:

```jsx
// get the data from the smart contract and print on console
const handleReadSmartContract = async () => {
  const ethersProvider = new BrowserProvider(walletProvider);
  const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner();
  const contract = new Contract(storageSC, storageABI, signer);
  const data = await contract.retrieve();
  console.log("data: ", data);
};

// write to the smart contract and print on console
const handleWriteSmartContract = async () => {
  const ethersProvider = new BrowserProvider(walletProvider);
  const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner();
  const contract = new Contract(storageSC, storageABI, signer);
  const data = await contract.store(1n);
  console.log("data: ", data);
};
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to integrate Reown AppKit with Wagmi or Ethers to interact with a smart contract.
With very few lines of code you can read and write to a smart contract.

Keep exploring AppKit to enhance your dApp's functionality and user experience!
