## Track your Growth from Day 1

Once your project is live, use Reown Dashboard to monitor real usage.

Open your Reown dashboard to get insights on:
    - **Active Users:** See how many real users are showing up and engaging.
    - **Sessions vs Wallet Connections:** Spot where users drop off during onboarding.
    - **Connected Wallet Addresses:** Useful for debugging, support, or onchain features.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Use these daily to track if your social push or product changes are working‚Äîand where to iterate next.
</Tip>

## Loop in Your Marketing Team

If you have a marketing team, now is the time to bring them in!

- Invite them to your project on Reown Dashboard.
- With Reown Dashboard access, your marketing team can:
    - **See what‚Äôs driving user growth -** *Active Users* helps measure impact from press, X threads, or paid drops.
    - **Identify onboarding friction -** If users start sessions but don‚Äôt connect wallets, that‚Äôs a signal to iterate.
    - **Understand your audience -** The wallet list gives you a view of actual users which would be useful for follow-ups, campaigns, or segmentation.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Even if you‚Äôre solo, these tools are built to help you grow like a full-stack team.
</Tip>

## Keep Momentum with Iteration

- Loop in your team to help with GTM and performance.
