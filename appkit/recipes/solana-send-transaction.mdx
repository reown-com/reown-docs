sidebarTitle: "Solana Transactions using Reown"
---

Learn how to use Reown for essential wallet functionalities such as signing messages, sending transactions, and retrieving wallet balances.

---

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Retrieve the balance of the connected wallet.
- Sign a message using a connected wallet.
- Send a transaction to the Solana blockchain.

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

## Reown Minimal Installation

You can start a small project following the guidelines from our [installation React docs using Solana](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation?platform=solana)

## Start building

In this guide, we are going to use the library [@solana/web3.js](https://solana.com/docs/clients/javascript-reference) to make the calls to the Solana blockchain and to interact with the wallet.

First, install the required dependency:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @solana/web3.js
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @solana/web3.js
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @solana/web3.js
```

```bash bun
bun add @solana/web3.js
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get Balance

Fetching a user's balance is straightforward using the Connection object from Solana.

1. Start by importing the `useAppKitConnection` hook from the solana Adapter, the `useAppKitAccount` AppKit hook to get the account information and `PublicKey` from the solana/web3 library.

```js
import { useAppKitConnection } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/react";
import { useAppKitAccount } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import { PublicKey, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";
```

2. Use the hooks to retrieve the connection Solana object, the user's address and check if they are connected.

```js
const { connection } = useAppKitConnection();
const { isConnected, address } = useAppKitAccount();
```

3. Create a function to fetch and display (in console) the balance when triggered

```js
// function to get the balance
const handleGetBalance = async () => {
  const wallet = new PublicKey(address);
  const balance = await connection?.getBalance(wallet); // get the amount in LAMPORTS

  console.log(`${balance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} SOL`);
};
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function you can show the button in a component when `isConnected` is `true`

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={getBalance}>Get Balance</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

### Sign a message

In order to raise the modal to sign a message with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing the `useAppKitProvider` hook.

```js
import { useAppKitProvider } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import type { Provider } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/react";
```

2. Extract the `walletProvider` function from the `useAppKitProvider` hook. This function allows you to prompt the connected wallet to sign a specific message. Also the `useAppKitAccount` AppKit hook to get the address and isConnected as explain before.

```js
// Get the wallet provider with the AppKit hook
const { walletProvider } = useAppKitProvider<Provider>("solana");

// AppKit hook to get the address and check if the user is connected
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount();
```

3. Create a function to prompt the modal for signing the message.

```js
// function to sign a msg
const handleSignMsg = async () => {
  // message to sign
  const encodedMessage = new TextEncoder().encode("Hello Reown AppKit!");

  // Raise the modal
  const sig = await walletProvider.signMessage(encodedMessage);

  // Print the signed message in hexadecimal format
  console.log(Buffer.from(sig).toString("hex"));
};
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSignMsg}>Sign Message</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

### Send a transaction in Solana

In order to raise the modal to sign and send a transaction with your wallet. It's a bit more complex, but you can follow these steps:

1. Start by importing very similar packages from the previous examples and also the Transaction and SystemProgram object from solana/web3.js library.

```js
import { useAppKitConnection } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/react";
import { PublicKey, Transaction, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { useAppKitAccount, useAppKitProvider } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import type { Provider } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/react";
```

2. Use the `useAppKitAccount`, useAppKitConnection and useAppKitProvider Reown hooks to get the connection object, the walletProvider and the address from the user.

```js
const { isConnected, address } = useAppKitAccount();
const { connection } = useAppKitConnection();
const { walletProvider } = useAppKitProvider<Provider>("solana");
```

3. Create the function to raise the modal to send the transaction

```js
// function to send a TX
const handleSendTx = () => {
    const latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();

    // create the transaction
    const transaction= new Transaction({
        feePayer: wallet,
        recentBlockhash: latestBlockhash?.blockhash,
      }).add(
        SystemProgram.transfer({
          fromPubkey: wallet,
          toPubkey: new PublicKey(address), // destination address
          lamports: 1000,
        })
      );

    // raise the modal
    const signature = await walletProvider.sendTransaction(transaction, connection)

    // print the Transaction Signature
    console.log(signature);
}
```

4. Finally, in order to call the function:

```jsx
return (
  isConnected && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSendTx}>Send Transaction</button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to integrate Reown and Solana into your React application to perform essential wallet operations.
You can now fetch wallet balances, sign messages, and send transactions in the Solana blockchain.
