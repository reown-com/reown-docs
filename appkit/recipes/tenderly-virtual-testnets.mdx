Learn how to use Reown AppKit to enable wallet connections and interact with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) Virtual Testnets. With AppKit, you can provide seamless wallet connections, including email and social logins, on-ramp functionality, smart accounts, one-click authentication, and wallet notifications, all designed to deliver an exceptional user experience. With Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets, you can replicate real networks for various stages of your Web3 app development.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Set up Reown AppKit.
2. Configure a wallet connection modal and enable interactions with Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets.

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s get started!

## Setup

In this section, you'll learn how to set up the development environment to use AppKit with Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets.

For this tutorial, we'll be using Next.js, though you can use any other framework compatible with AppKit.

> AppKit is available on eight frameworks, including React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS, and Unity.

Now, let’s create a Next app. In order to do so, please run the command given below:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest appkit-vTestnet-example
```

The above command creates a Next app and sets the name of the Next app as “appkit-vTestnet-example”.

### Install AppKit

Now, we need to install AppKit and other dependencies that we need for our app to function as expected. For this tutorial, we will be using “wagmi” as our preferred Ethereum library. However, you can also use [Ethers](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/installation?platform=ethers).

```bash
npm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-wagmi-adapter wagmi @tanstack/react-query
```

> You can also use other package managers such as `yarn`, `bun`, `pnpm`, etc.

### Create a new project on Reown Cloud

Now, we need to get a project Id from Reown Cloud that we will use to set up AppKit with Wagmi config. Navigate to [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com) and sign in. If you have not created an account yet, please do so before we proceed.

After you have logged in, please navigate to the “**Projects**” section of the Cloud and click on “**Create Project**”.

### Create a Virtual TestNet using Tenderly

Navigate to [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer) and login. If you don’t have an account already, then please sign up.

Now, navigate to “**Virtual TestNets**” on the dashboard.
<Frame>
![image.png](/images/recipes/tenderly6.png)
</Frame>
Click on **“Create Virtual TestNet.”** Next, you’ll be prompted to select the parent network. For simplicity, select **“Sepolia”** as the parent network, though you can choose any network you prefer.

Now, enter a name for your Virtual TestNet. Under **“Chain ID,”** select **“Custom”** and enter a unique chain ID, like **“73571,”** to avoid conflicts with the existing Sepolia chain. Set **“Public Explorer”** to **“On”** and **“Smart Contract Visibility”** to **“Full.”**
<Frame>
![image.png](/images/recipes/tenderly7.png)
</Frame>
Now, click on **“Create”** to set up the Virtual TestNet. You will see that your Virtual TestNet has been created, and you can find the RPC and other relevant information for it. Please copy the `HTTPS` URL under “**Public**” as this will be your Virtual TestNet’s RPC URL.

## Build the App

Before we build the app, let’s first configure our `.env` file. On the root level of your code directory, create a new file named `.env`.

Open that file and create a new variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`. You will assign the project Id that you copied in the previous step to this environment variable that you just created. You need to do the same for `TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC`. This is what it will look like:

```jsx
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID = <YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE>
TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC = <YOUR_TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC_URL>
```

<Note>
**_Note:_** Please make sure you follow the best practices when you are working with secret keys and other sensitive information. Environment variables that start with `NEXT_PUBLIC` will be exposed by your app which can be misused by bad actors.
</Note>
### Configure AppKit

We’ve created an in-depth technical guide on getting started with Reown AppKit on any EVM chain. Refer to the guide below to learn how to configure AppKit. A GitHub repository is also provided at the end of the guide, which you can clone to quickly get started.

[How to Get Started with Reown AppKit on Any EVM Chain](https://reown.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-reown-appkit-on-any-evm-chain)

### Configure Tenderly Virtual TestNet with AppKit

In order to set up Tenderly’s Virtual TestNet with AppKit, you need to first configure your Tenderly Virtual TestNet as a custom chain.

Inside your `/app` directory, create a new file named `tenderly.config.ts`. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., `app/tenderly.config.ts`.

```tsx
import { defineChain } from "@reown/appkit/networks";

export const vTestnet = defineChain({
  id: 73571, // Add this to match the chain Id you set for your Virtual TestNet
  caipNetworkId: "eip155:73571",
  chainNamespace: "eip155",
  name: "Virtual Sepolia",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "vSepolia", symbol: "vETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: [process.env.TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC!],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: "Tenderly Explorer",
      url: "https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer/vnet/6a6910ba-5831-4758-9d89-1f8e3169433f", // replace this with your your Virtual TestNet's explorer URL
    },
  },
  contracts: {
    ensRegistry: {
      address: "0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e",
    },
    ensUniversalResolver: {
      address: "0xE4Acdd618deED4e6d2f03b9bf62dc6118FC9A4da",
      blockCreated: 16773775,
    },
    multicall3: {
      address: "0xca11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976ca11",
      blockCreated: 14353601,
    },
  },
});
```

1. `id` - set this to the chain Id that you passed while creating the Virtual TestNet on Tenderly.
2. `url` - set this with your your Virtual TestNet's explorer URL. You can find this URL within your Virtual TestNet’s configuration on Tenderly Dashboard.

</Frame>
Now, in your `config/index.tsx` file, import `vTestnet` from `app/tenderly.config.ts`. You’ll also need to configure transports within the `WagmiAdapter` function. Refer to the code snippet below.

```tsx
import { cookieStorage, createStorage, http } from "@wagmi/core";
import { WagmiAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi";
import { mainnet, arbitrum } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
import { vTestnet } from "@/app/tenderly.config";
import type { AppKitNetwork } from '@reown/appkit/networks';

// Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com
export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID;

if (!projectId) {
  throw new Error("Project ID is not defined");
}

export const networks = [mainnet, arbitrum, vTestnet] as [AppKitNetwork, ...AppKitNetwork[]];

//Set up the Wagmi Adapter (Config)
export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  storage: createStorage({
    storage: cookieStorage,
  }),
  ssr: true,
  transports: {
    [vTestnet.id]: http(process.env.TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC!),
  },
  networks,
  projectId,
});

export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig;
```

Now, inside your `context/index.tsx` file, you also need to import `vTestnet` and pass it as one of the supported networks within the `createAppKit` function, as shown below.

```tsx
"use client";

import { wagmiAdapter, projectId } from "@/config";
import { createAppKit } from "@reown/appkit/react";
import { mainnet, arbitrum } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
import { vTestnet } from "@/app/tenderly.config";

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import React, { type ReactNode } from "react";
import { cookieToInitialState, WagmiProvider, type Config } from "wagmi";

// Set up queryClient
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

if (!projectId) {
  throw new Error("Project ID is not defined");
}

// Set up metadata
const metadata = {
  //this is optional
  name: "appkit-example",
  description: "AppKit Example - EVM",
  url: "https://exampleapp.com", // origin must match your domain & subdomain
  icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
};

// Create the modal
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum, vTestnet],
  metadata: metadata,
  features: {
    analytics: true, // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
  },
});

function ContextProvider({
  children,
  cookies,
}: {
  children: ReactNode;
  cookies: string | null;
}) {
  const initialState = cookieToInitialState(
    wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config,
    cookies
  );

  return (
    <WagmiProvider
      config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config}
      initialState={initialState}
    >
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}

export default ContextProvider;
```

You can now run the app and test it out. In order to do so, run the command given below.

```bash
npm run dev
```

> If you are using alternative package managers, you can try either of these commands - `yarn dev`, or `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`.
