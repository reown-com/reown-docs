Once an account is subscribed to your app's notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

- [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
- [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

## Authentication

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

## Sending notifications

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

- `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Dashboard.
- `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
- `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
- `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
- `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](#rate-limits) below.
- `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to dedup multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call's `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

```typescript
type RequestBody = {
  notification_id?: string | null;
  notification: {
    type: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
    url?: string | null;
  };
  accounts: string[];
};
```

## Get subscribers

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

<Tabs queryString={'api-client'}>

<Tab title="JavaScript">

```typescript
const PROJECT_ID = '<PROJECT_ID>'
const NOTIFY_API_SECRET = '<NOTIFY_API_SECRET>'
const requestBody: RequestBody = {
  accounts: [
    'eip155:1:0x9AfEaC202C837df470b5A145e0EfD6a574B21029',
    'eip155:1:0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  ]
}

const response = await fetch(`https://notify.walletconnect.com/v1/${PROJECT_ID}/subscribers`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${NOTIFY_API_SECRET}`
  }
  body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
})

const subscribers: ResponseBody = await response.json()

type RequestBody = {
  // Max 100 accounts
  accounts: string[]
}
type ResponseBody = {
  [account: string]: Subscriber
}
type Subscriber = {
  notification_types: string[]
}
```

    "notification_types": ["4d1c97ad-c182-4097-8f2c-8f80c0674df2"]
  }
}
```

## Get all subscribers

<Warning>
  This endpoint will download _all_ subscribers of your app, which is an
  expensive operation and can take several seconds to complete. Because of this,
  it has a low rate limit.
</Warning>

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

<Tabs queryString={'api-client'}>

<Tab title="JavaScript">

```typescript
const PROJECT_ID = "<PROJECT_ID>";
const NOTIFY_API_SECRET = "<NOTIFY_API_SECRET>";
const response = await fetch(
  `https://notify.walletconnect.com/${PROJECT_ID}/subscribers`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${NOTIFY_API_SECRET}`,
    },
  }
);
const subscribers: string[] = await response.json();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl 'https://notify.walletconnect.com/<PROJECT_ID>/subscribers' \

## Mark all notifications as read

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be "unread". Because of this, when you
initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received
notifications in the past will have notifications display as "unread" even if they already have seen them.
This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint
which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute
to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to
reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

const PROJECT_ID = "<PROJECT_ID>";
const NOTIFY_API_SECRET = "<NOTIFY_API_SECRET>";

  {

## Rate limits

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

- `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
  - Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
  - Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
- `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
  - Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
- `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
  - Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
- `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
  - Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
