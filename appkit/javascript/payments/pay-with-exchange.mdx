**Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their Centralized Exchange (CEXs) accounts like Binance or Coinbase, with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.

## Quick Start  
Here you can find a simplify process to integrate Pay with Javascript SDK:

<Warning>
    Projects first need to install and set up Reown before integrating Pay. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Reown docs](/appkit/overview#quickstart).
</Warning>

### Install the library

<Note>
   Projects currently using Reown to enable self-custodial wallet payments in their own checkout flows are encouraged to switch to Pay for a simpler integration and significantly improved user experience. Pay can be found in `@reown/appkit-pay` npm package.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-pay
```
</CodeGroup>

### `pay` - Full Payment Flow

#### Usage
```ts
import { pay, baseSepoliaETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

This function handles the complete payment flow — it opens the payment UI *and* waits for the result (success, failure, cancel, timeout). This function receives three values: `recipient`, `amount`, and `paymentAsset`.

```ts
// pay function returns a PaymentResult object
const result = await pay({
    recipient: addressRecipient,
    amount: amount,
    paymentAsset: baseSepoliaETH
});

if (result.success) {
    console.log("Payment successful: " + result.result);
} else {
    console.error("Payment error: " + result.error);
}
```

## Prerequisites

### Enable Payments Feature in Dashboard

The "Payments" feature **must be enabled** in the [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com) before you can use Pay, even for local testing. 

1. Go to your project in the Reown Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Payments section
3. Enable the Payments feature for your projectId


## Test locally

In order to test locally use localhost and port 3000. This is the only port available for local testing.

Add the following to your package.json file in order to run the development server on port 3000:
```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --port 3000",
},
```

## Supported Networks and Assets

For a complete list of supported networks and assets across different exchanges (Coinbase, Binance), please refer to the [Networks and Assets Supported](/appkit/payments/pay-with-exchange#networks-and-assets-supported) section in our Pay with Exchange documentation.

## Assets Configuration

For the moment, Pay has pre-configured these assets: 
- baseETH, baseSepoliaETH, and baseUSDC
- ethereumUSDC, optimismUSDC, arbitrumUSDC, polygonUSDC and solanaUSDC
- ethereumUSDT, optimismUSDT, arbitrumUSDT, polygonUSDT and solanaUSDT

```ts
import { baseETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

For custom assets, you can create a paymentAsset object with all the information:

```ts
// Configure the paymentAsset
const paymentAssetDetails = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: 'native', // Or USDC in Base: '0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913'
    metadata: {
        name: 'Ethereum', // Or 'USD Coin'
        symbol: 'ETH',    // Or 'USDC'
        decimals: 18      // Or 6 for USDC
    }
};
```
