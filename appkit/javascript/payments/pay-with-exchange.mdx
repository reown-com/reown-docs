**AppKit Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their Centralized Exchange (CEXs) accounts like Binance or Coinbase, with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.

## Quick Start  
Here you can find a simplify process to integrate AppKit Pay with Javascript SDK:

<Warning>
    Projects first need to install and set up Reown AppKit before integrating AppKit Pay. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Reown AppKit docs](/appkit/overview#quickstart).
</Warning>

### Install the library

<Note>
   Projects currently using Reown AppKit to enable self-custodial wallet payments in their own checkout flows are encouraged to switch to AppKit Pay for a simpler integration and significantly improved user experience. AppKit Pay can be found in `@reown/appkit-pay` npm package.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-pay
```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage
```ts
import { pay, openPay, baseSepoliaETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

There are two main functions for handling payments:

#### `pay` - Full Payment Flow
This function handles the complete payment flow â€” it opens the payment UI *and* waits for the result (success, failure, cancel, timeout). This function receives three parameters: `recipient`, `amount`, and `paymentAsset`.

```ts
// pay function returns a PaymentResult object
const result = await pay({
    recipient: addressRecipient,
    amount: amount,
    paymentAsset: baseSepoliaETH
});

if (result.success) {
    console.log("Payment successful: " + result.result);
} else {
    console.error("Payment error: " + result.error);
}
```

#### `openPay` - Open Payment UI Only
This function opens or triggers the payment UI modal but doesn't return the result of the payment. Use this when you want to handle the payment result through other means (like subscriptions or polling).

```ts
// openPay just opens the modal without waiting for the result
openPay({
    recipient: addressRecipient,
    amount: amount,
    paymentAsset: baseSepoliaETH
});

// Handle the result separately using getPayResult() or subscriptions
```

## Prerequisites

### Enable Payments Feature in Dashboard

<Warning>
The "Payments" feature **must be enabled** in the [Reown Dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com) before you can use AppKit Pay, even for local testing. 

1. Go to your project in the Reown Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Payments section
3. Enable the Payments feature for your project

Without enabling this feature in the dashboard, payment functionality will not work even if your integration is correctly implemented.
</Warning>

### Local Testing Requirements

In order to test locally, you must use **localhost:3000**. This is the only port available for local testing.

Add the following to your package.json file:
```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --port 3000",
},
```

## Supported Networks and Assets

For a complete list of supported networks and assets across different exchanges (Coinbase, Binance), please refer to the [Networks and Assets Supported](/appkit/payments/pay-with-exchange#networks-and-assets-supported) section in our Pay with Exchange documentation.

## Assets Configuration

For the moment, AppKit Pay has pre-configured these assets: 
- baseETH, baseSepoliaETH, and baseUSDC
- ethereumUSDC, optimismUSDC, arbitrumUSDC, polygonUSDC and solanaUSDC
- ethereumUSDT, optimismUSDT, arbitrumUSDT, polygonUSDT and solanaUSDT

```ts
import { baseETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

For custom assets, you can create a paymentAsset object with all the information:

```ts
// Configure the paymentAsset
const paymentAssetDetails = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: 'native', // Or USDC in Base: '0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913'
    metadata: {
        name: 'Ethereum', // Or 'USD Coin'
        symbol: 'ETH',    // Or 'USDC'
        decimals: 18      // Or 6 for USDC
    }
};
```

## Functions

### getPayError
Use with caution regarding timing; subscriptions are preferred.

`getPayError(): AppKitPayErrorMessage | null`
