**AppKit Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their Centralized Exchange (CEXs) accounts like Binance or Coinbase, with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.

## Quick Start  
Here you can find a simplify process to integrate AppKit Pay with Javascript SDK:

<Warning>
    Projects first need to install and set up Reown AppKit before integrating AppKit Pay. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Reown AppKit docs](/appkit/overview#quickstart).
</Warning>

### Install the library

<Note>
   Projects currently using Reown AppKit to enable self-custodial wallet payments in their own checkout flows are encouraged to switch to AppKit Pay for a simpler integration and significantly improved user experience. AppKit Pay can be found in `@reown/appkit-pay` npm package.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-pay
```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage
```ts
import { usePay } from '@reown/appkit-pay';
import { baseSepoliaETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

In order to run the payment, we are using the function `openPay`. 

```ts
// --- Open Modal ---
await openPay({
    recipient: addressRecipient,
    amount: 0.0001,
    paymentAsset: baseSepoliaETH
});
```


## Assets Configuration

For the moment, AppKit Pay has pre-configured these assets: baseETH, baseSepoliaETH, and baseUSDC.

```ts
import { baseETH, baseSepoliaETH, baseUSDC } from '@reown/appkit-pay' 
```

For custom assets, you can create a paymentAsset object with all the information:

```ts
// Configure the paymentAsset
const paymentAssetDetails = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: 'native', // Or USDC in Base: '0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913'
    metadata: {
        name: 'Ethereum', // Or 'USD Coin'
        symbol: 'ETH',    // Or 'USDC'
        decimals: 18      // Or 6 for USDC
    }
};
```

## Functions
