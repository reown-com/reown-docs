## Wallet Buttons

Wallet buttons are components that allow users to connect their wallets to your dApp. They provide a simple and easy way to connect to the top 20 wallets, WalletConnect QR, and all the social logins.
You can also call them directly using hooks. Please check the [components](/appkit/react/core/components#walletButtons) and [hooks](/appkit/react/core/hooks#useappkitwallet) documentation for more information.
