title:  Upgrade from Web3Modal to Reown AppKit on Unity
sidebarTitle: Reown - Unity
---

This document outlines the steps to migrate from the old `com.walletconnect` packages to the new `com.reown` package in your Unity project.

### Step 1. Replace the corresponding dependency in your manifest.json

```json {6-7, 17-18}
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Remove the following code lines
    "com.walletconnect.web3modal": "1.0.0",

    // Add the following code lines
    "com.reown.appkit": "0.4.2"
  },
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "package.openupm.com",
      "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
      "scopes": [
        // Remove the following code lines
        "com.walletconnect",

        // Add the following code lines
        "com.reown"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the OpenUPM CLI:

```bash {4-5}
# Remove the old package
openupm remove com.walletconnect.web3modal

# Add the new package
openupm add com.reown.appkit
```

If the `com.walletconnect.web3modal` package was installed manually via the Package Manager window or directly from the GitHub repository,
remove all `com.walletconnect` packages and replace them with the `com.reown` packages. You can find the list of all necessary packages in the
[Installation Documentation](/appkit/unity/core/installation#package) under `Package Manager with OpenUPM` tab.

### Step 2. Update your Reown config

The `com.walletconnect.web3modal` package used two configuration objects: `WalletConnectProjectConfig` scriptable object
and optional `Web3ModalConfig` class.

The Reown combines these two configurations into a single `AppKitConfig` class that can be passed into Reown initialization method.

1. Delete `WalletConnectProjectConfig` scriptable object
2. Initialize Reown from your script

```csharp
private async void Start()
{
    await AppKit.InitializeAsync(
        new AppKitConfig(
            projectId: "Your Project ID from WalletConnectProjectConfig",
            new Metadata(
                name: "My Game",
                description: "Example description",
                url: "https://example.com",
                iconUrl: "Your icon URL"
            )
        )
    );
}
```

### Step 3. Update references to the namespaces

The modern IDE such as Rider or Visual Studio should be able to automatically update the namespaces for you.
If not, you can manually update the namespaces as follows:

<Table
  headers={["Old", "New"]}
  data={[
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnect.Web3Modal" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Reown.Unity" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectUnity.Nethereum" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Sign.Nethereum.Unity" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Sign" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Sign" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectUnity.Core" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Sign.Unity" },
    },
  ]}
/>

Note that some objects from `WalletConnectUnity.Core` were moved into `Reown.AppKit.Unity` namespace, therefore we
recommend to rely on the IDE to automatically update the namespaces.

### Step 4. Update references to the classes

Change `Web3Modal` to `AppKit` in your codebase. For example:

```csharp {4-5, 10-11}
// Remove the following code line
Web3Modal.Open();

// Add the following code line
AppKit.Open();

// Remove the following code line
await Web3Modal.Evm.SendTransactionAsync(address, value);

// Add the following code line
await AppKit.Evm.SendTransactionAsync(address, value);
```

### Step 5. Rename USS variables

If you customized any Reown USS variables, simply change `--wui` part of the variable name to `--ro`. For example:

```css {4-5}
// Remove the following code line
--wui-color-accent-100: rgb(156, 81, 65);

// Add the following code line
--ro-color-accent-100: rgb(156, 81, 65);
```

### Final notes

- Ensure that you have updated all relevant configurations and imports in your project to reflect the changes from Web3Modal to AppKit.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure that the migration has been successful and that all functionality is working as expected.
