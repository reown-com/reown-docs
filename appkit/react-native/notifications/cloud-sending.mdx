title: Sending with Dashboard
---

You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](./cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in [several places](overview#subscribing-and-receiving-notifications) including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com), in your app with our [frontend SDK](frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com) under the Notify API section:

1. In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.

2. This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.
