title: Swaps
---

Let users swap tokens seamlessly inside your React Native app using AppKit’s Swaps feature. With built-in provider support and real-time pricing, users can trade tokens across chains without leaving your app.

## Configuration

Swaps are enabled by default. You can enable or disable it explicitly like this:

```typescript {4-6}
createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    swaps: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

Set `swaps: false` to turn off the feature.

## Usage

### Open the Swaps View

Use the `useAppKit` hook to launch the Swaps view:

```typescript {2, 5}
function SwapButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleSwapPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'Swap' });
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Swap Tokens"
      onPress={handleSwapPress}
    />
  );
}
```

### What Users Can Expect

1. Tapping “Swap Tokens” opens a dedicated swap interface.
2. Users can:
   - Select the token to swap from
   - Select the token to receive
   - Enter the amount
