title: On-Ramp
---

AppKit’s On-Ramp feature lets your users easily buy crypto with fiat—right inside your React Native app. With support for 100+ cryptocurrencies and global payment options, it helps users start transacting quickly and securely across multiple chains.

## Configuration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default. To customize or disable it:

```typescript {4-6}
createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    onramp: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

Set `onramp: false` to disable the feature.

## Usage

### Open the On-Ramp View

Use the `useAppKit` hook to trigger the On-Ramp view programmatically:

```typescript {2, 5}
function OnRampButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleOnRampPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'OnRamp' });
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Buy Crypto"
      onPress={handleOnRampPress}
    />
  );
}
```

### What Users Can Expect

1. When users tap “Buy Crypto”, they’re guided to a clean, intuitive interface.
2. They can:
   - Choose their local fiat currency
   - Pick the token they want to buy
   - Enter the desired amount
   - Select a payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
   - Review all fees and exchange rates transparently
3. After confirming, they’re securely redirected to the provider to complete the purchase.
4. Once done, the crypto lands in their wallet—automatically.
