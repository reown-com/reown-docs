AppKit enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails or social network.

<Note>

Due to Safariâ€™s strict third-party cookie policies, the SDK is not preserving sessions after the app is closed. Our team is working to solve this issue soon.

## Options

- **_email [boolean]_** : This boolean defines whether you want to enable email login. Default `true`
- **_socials [array]_** : This array contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. The platforms supported are X, Discord and Apple. The default value of `undefined` displays everything. Set it to `false` to disable this feature. You can also pass an empty array to disable it.
- **_emailShowWallets [boolean]_** : This boolean defines whether you want to show the wallet options on the first connect screen. If this is false and `socials` are enabled, it will show a button that directs you to a new screen displaying the wallet options. Default `true`

## User Flow

1. Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. AppKit will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to
   verify the user's authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and email login.

   - For Social options, the One Time Password (OTP) is not sent.

2. Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing "Upgrade Wallet" on AppKit.
   This will open the _([WalletConnect secure website](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard))_ that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
