title: Migrate to Multichain
description: A guide to help you migrate your existing Reown AppKit React Native integration to the new multichain version.
---

import { Card, CardGroup } from '@mintlify/components';

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to update your existing Reown AppKit React Native integration to the latest multichain version. The new version introduces a more flexible and powerful architecture, centered around a core AppKit library and distinct chain-specific adapters.

For a deeper understanding of the new architecture, please review the [Architecture](./architecture) page.

## Key Changes at a Glance

Before diving into the specific steps, here's a high-level overview of the most significant changes:

-   **Core Library & Adapters:** Instead of using monolithic, EVM-specific packages like `@reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native` or `@reown/appkit-ethers-react-native` as your primary entry point, you will now use a core package `@reown/appkit-react-native`. Chain-specific logic for EVM (Ethers, Wagmi), Solana, Bitcoin, and potentially other chains is handled by separate, installable adapter packages (e.g., `@reown/appkit-ethers-react-native`, `@reown/appkit-solana-react-native`).
-   **Centralized Logic:** The new `appkit` instance (initialized via `createAppKit`) becomes the central hub for managing connections, adapters, and events across multiple chains.
-   **Unified Hooks & Components:** Hooks and UI components are now consistently imported from the core `@reown/appkit-react-native` package.

## 1. Dependency Updates

Your first step is to update your project's dependencies.

### a. Remove Old Packages (If Applicable)
If you were previously using older, specific AppKit packages like `@web3modal/*` or potentially differently named predecessors to `@reown/appkit-*-react-native`, you should remove them. The primary packages to focus on now are `@reown/appkit-react-native` and the new chain adapters.

### b. Install Core Package & Polyfills/Helpers
Install the main AppKit library along with essential peer dependencies for React Native:

```bash
# For Expo projects
npx expo install @reown/appkit-react-native@alpha @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-svg react-native-modal @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat expo-application

# For React Native CLI projects
npm install @reown/appkit-react-native@alpha @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-svg react-native-modal @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
# or
yarn add @reown/appkit-react-native@alpha @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-svg react-native-modal @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```
Then, for iOS in React Native CLI projects:
```bash
npx pod-install
```

### c. Install Chain Adapter Packages
Based on the blockchains your dApp needs to support, install the corresponding adapter packages. Here are the primary ones:

-   **EVM (Ethers):**
    ```bash
    # For Expo
    npx expo install @reown/appkit-ethers-react-native@alpha
    # For RN CLI
    # npm install @reown/appkit-ethers-react-native@alpha
    # yarn add @reown/appkit-ethers-react-native@alpha
    ```
-   **EVM (Wagmi):**
    ```bash
    # For Expo
    npx expo install @reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native@alpha wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    # For RN CLI
    # npm install @reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native@alpha wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    # yarn add @reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native@alpha wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```
-   **Solana:**
    ```bash
    # For Expo
    npx expo install @reown/appkit-solana-react-native@alpha
    # For RN CLI
    # npm install @reown/appkit-solana-react-native@alpha
    # yarn add @reown/appkit-solana-react-native@alpha
    ```
-   **Bitcoin:**
    ```bash
    # For Expo
    npx expo install @reown/appkit-bitcoin-react-native@alpha
    # For RN CLI
    # npm install @reown/appkit-bitcoin-react-native@alpha
    # yarn add @reown/appkit-bitcoin-react-native@alpha
    ```

<Note>
The package names for adapters like `@reown/appkit-ethers-react-native` and `@reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native` are the same as some older, more monolithic packages. The key difference is how they are used (as pluggable adapters into the core `@reown/appkit-react-native`).
</Note>

## 2. Crucial Polyfill Import

To ensure proper functioning, especially for WalletConnect features within React Native, the `@walletconnect/react-native-compat` package must be imported at the very beginning of your application's entry point or your AppKit configuration file.

```typescript
// App.tsx or your AppKitConfig.ts
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat"; // MUST BE THE VERY FIRST IMPORT

// ... other imports like React, createAppKit, adapters, etc.
```

This step is critical for avoiding runtime errors related to missing polyfills.

## 3. AppKit Initialization (`createAppKit`)

The way you initialize AppKit has changed significantly to support the new adapter-based architecture.

### Old Implementation

Previously, for an EVM setup with Wagmi, you might have done something like this

```typescript
// Old implementation
import { createAppKit, defaultWagmiConfig } from "@reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native";
import { mainnet, polygon } from "@wagmi/chains";

const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
const metadata = { /* ... */ };
const chains = [mainnet, polygon];

const wagmiConfig = defaultWagmiConfig({ chains, projectId, metadata });

const appKitInstance = createAppKit({
  wagmiConfig,
  projectId,
  metadata,
  // ... other options
});
```

### New Multichain Implementation

With the new version, you initialize adapters first and then pass them to `createAppKit` from the core `@reown/appkit-react-native` package.

```typescript
// New approach: src/AppKitConfig.ts (or your preferred file)
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat"; // Ensure this is the first import

import { createAppKit, type AppKitNetwork } from "@reown/appkit-react-native";
import { EthersAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-ethers-react-native";
import { SolanaAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-solana-react-native";
import { BitcoinAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-bitcoin-react-native";
import { WagmiAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native";

// Import chain definitions (examples)
import { mainnet as viemMainnet, polygon as viemPolygon } from "viem/chains"; // For EVM
import { solana, bitcoin } from "@reown/appkit-react-native"; // Pre-defined AppKitNetwork objects

const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"; // Obtain from https://dashboard.reown.com/

const metadata = {
  name: "My Awesome Multi-Chain dApp",
  description: "My dApp supporting multiple blockchains!",
  url: "https://myapp.com",
  icons: ["https://myapp.com/icon.png"],
  redirect: {
    native: "YOUR_APP_SCHEME://", // e.g., "myapp://"
    universal: "YOUR_APP_UNIVERSAL_LINK.com", // e.g., "https://myapp.com/connect"
  },
};

// 1. Define your AppKitNetworks (for AppKit's UI and network management)
// These can come from viem/chains (for EVM) or be custom AppKitNetwork objects.
const appNetworks: AppKitNetwork[] = [
  viemMainnet, // viem chains are automatically compatible as AppKitNetwork for 'eip155'
  viemPolygon,
  solana,      // Pre-defined AppKit solana network
  bitcoin,     // Pre-defined AppKit bitcoin network
  // You can also define custom AppKitNetwork objects here
];

// 2. Initialize Adapters for the chains you want to support
// For EVM chains, choose ONE of the following adapters (EthersAdapter or WagmiAdapter):

// Option A: EthersAdapter for general EVM support
const ethersAdapter = new EthersAdapter();

// Option B: WagmiAdapter if you are using Wagmi for EVM state management
const wagmiEvmNetworks = [viemMainnet, viemPolygon]; // Subset of appNetworks or specific Wagmi chains
const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  projectId,
  networks: wagmiEvmNetworks, // These are Wagmi/viem chain objects
});

// Initialize adapters for other chains as needed
const solanaAdapter = new SolanaAdapter();
const bitcoinAdapter = new BitcoinAdapter();

// 3. Create the AppKit instance
// In this example, we'll use EthersAdapter for EVM chains.
// If you chose WagmiAdapter, replace ethersAdapter with wagmiAdapter below.
export const appKit = createAppKit({
  projectId,
  metadata,
  networks: appNetworks, // Master list of networks for AppKit UI and context
  adapters: [
    ethersAdapter,  // Handles EVM chains defined in 'networks'
    // wagmiAdapter, // Or use this if you chose Wagmi for EVM
    solanaAdapter,  // Handles Solana chains
    bitcoinAdapter, // Handles Bitcoin chains
  ],
  // Optional: specify a default network from your 'networks' list
  // defaultNetwork: viemMainnet,
  // ... other AppKit options (see Options page)
});
```

**Key differences in initialization:**
-   `createAppKit` is imported from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
-   You explicitly create instances of the adapters you need (e.g., `new EthersAdapter()`, `new WagmiAdapter(...)`).
-   The `adapters` array in `createAppKit` takes these initialized adapter instances.
-   The `networks` array in `createAppKit` takes `AppKitNetwork` objects, which define all supported networks for AppKit's UI and context. `viem/chains` objects can be directly used for EVM networks.
-   For the `WagmiAdapter`, the `networks` property in its constructor defines which EVM chains *it* will specifically manage using Wagmi.

## 4. Provider Setup

The way you set up providers in your `App.tsx` (or equivalent root file) has minor adjustments, especially if you are using Wagmi.

### a. `AppKitProvider`
You will now need to wrap your application (or the relevant part) with `AppKitProvider` from `@reown/appkit-react-native`. This provider makes the AppKit instance, created in the previous step, available to all child components and hooks.

```tsx
// App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppKitProvider } from '@reown/appkit-react-native';
import { appKit } from './AppKitConfig'; // Your configured AppKit instance
import YourAppRootComponent from './YourAppRootComponent'; // Or your main app layout

function App() {
  return (
    <AppKitProvider instance={appKit}>
      <YourAppRootComponent />
    </AppKitProvider>
  );
}
export default App;
```

### b. Wagmi Specific Providers (`WagmiProvider`, `QueryClientProvider`)
If you're using the `WagmiAdapter`, you still need to set up `WagmiProvider` (from `wagmi`) and `QueryClientProvider` (from `@tanstack/react-query`) as you did before. The primary change is that the `config` prop for `WagmiProvider` now comes directly from your initialized `WagmiAdapter` instance's `wagmiConfig` property.

```tsx
// App.tsx (if using WagmiAdapter)
import React from 'react';
import { AppKitProvider } from '@reown/appkit-react-native';
import { appKit, wagmiAdapter } from './AppKitConfig'; 
import YourAppRootComponent from './YourAppRootComponent';

import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <AppKitProvider instance={appKit}>
      <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig} reconnectOnMount={false}>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <YourAppRootComponent />
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </WagmiProvider>
    </AppKitProvider>
  );
}
export default App;
```

### c. Rendering AppKit UI
Ensure the `<AppKit />` component (imported from `@reown/appkit-react-native`) is included in your app's component tree, typically in your root component, to render the modal UI. This was likely already in place.

```tsx
// YourAppRootComponent.tsx (Simplified)
import React from 'react';
import { AppKit } from '@reown/appkit-react-native';
// ... your other components ...

function YourAppRootComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Your app's content */}
      {/* ... e.g., ConnectButton, etc. ... */}
      
      <AppKit /> {/* This renders the modal and other AppKit UI */}
    </>
  );
}
export default YourAppRootComponent;
```

## 5. Configuration Options (`createAppKit` parameters)

Many configuration options previously passed to `createAppKit` (or `defaultConfig`/`defaultWagmiConfig`) are still available but are now part of the single `createAppKit` call from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
-   **`networks`**: As described above, an array of `AppKitNetwork` objects.
-   **`adapters`**: As described, an array of initialized adapter instances.
-   **`defaultNetwork`**:  (Formerly `defaultChain`).
-   **`networkImages`**: (Formerly `chainImages`).
-   **`tokens`**: New property (`Record<string, { address: string }>`) for displaying token balances.

Refer to the [Options](./options) documentation for the complete and up-to-date list of configuration parameters.

## 6. Hooks Migration

All AppKit hooks are now imported directly from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.

-   **`useAppKit()`**:
    -   Import from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
    -   Still the primary hook for modal control (`open`, `close`, `isOpen`).
    -   Now also includes actions like `disconnect` and `switchNetwork`.
-   **`useAccount()`**:
    -   Import from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
    -   Provides `address`, `chainId`, `isConnected`, and potentially other multichain-aware details. Functionality is largely the same; primary change is the import path and potentially more multichain-aware return values.
-   **`useProvider()` (New Hook)**:
    -   Import from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
    -   Use this to get the underlying chain-specific provider/client (e.g., Ethers provider, Wagmi client, Solana connection).
    -   Can be called with a namespace (e.g., `'eip155'`, `'solana'`) to get a provider for a specific chain type if multiple are connected or configured.
-   **`useAppKitEventSubscription()` (New Hook)**:
    -   Import from `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
    -   Allows subscription to various AppKit lifecycle events.
-   **Deprecated Hooks:**
    -   `useAppKitState`: Its functionality is largely covered by `useAccount`, `useAppKit`, and other more specific hooks. Review your usage and map to the new hooks.
    -   `useDisconnect`: The `disconnect` function is now available from `useAppKit().disconnect()`.

Review the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for detailed API information.

## 7. Components Migration

Update all UI component imports to use `@reown/appkit-react-native`. Key components include:

-   `<AppKit />`
-   `<AppKitButton />`
-   `<ConnectButton />`
-   `<AccountButton />`
-   `<NetworkButton />`

Their core functionality and props remain largely the same as before, but ensure you're importing them from the new unified package. Refer to the [Components](./components) documentation for details on props if needed.

## Summary of Key Actions

1.  **Update Dependencies:** Switch to `@reown/appkit-react-native` and add new adapter packages.
2.  **Ensure Polyfill:** Add `import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat";` as the very first import.
3.  **Revamp Initialization:** Use the new `createAppKit` signature with `networks` and `adapters` arrays.
4.  **Adjust Provider Setup:** Set up `AppKitProvider`. For Wagmi, use `wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig` for `WagmiProvider`.
5.  **Update Hook Imports:** Change all hook imports to `@reown/appkit-react-native` and adapt to API changes (e.g., `useDisconnect` -> `useAppKit().disconnect`, new hooks like `useProvider`).
6.  **Update Component Imports:** Change all component imports to `@reown/appkit-react-native`.
7.  **Add `<AppKit />`:** Ensure this component is rendered for the modal UI.
8.  **Review Options:** Check your `createAppKit` options against the new [Options](./options) documentation.

This migration involves some significant structural changes, but the result is a more robust and flexible system for building multichain React Native applications. If you encounter issues, refer to the main documentation pages or seek support.
