## One-Click Auth

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as ["ReCaps"](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary.
WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

## Pre-requisites

In order for One-Click Auth to work, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. **Enable SIWX in your AppKit configuration** - One-Click Auth requires [SIWX (Sign In With X)](./siwx) to be enabled in your AppKit setup.

2. **Configure EVM chains only** - One-Click Auth currently supports EVM chains only. Make sure your AppKit [networks](./options#networks) configuration includes only EVM-compatible chains.

3. **Use [Reown Authentication](./reown-authentication) or set up a backend** - You need to have a backend to communicate with. This backend will be used to generate a nonce, verify messages and handle sessions.

### How It Works

When users connect their wallet with One-Click Auth enabled:
1. The connection and SIWE message sign are done in a single step
2. Your backend receives and verifies the signature
3. The user is authenticated and ready to use your app
