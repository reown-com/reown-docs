AppKit comes with a set of pre-built UI components to help you quickly integrate wallet connection and display functionalities into your React Native application. You can import them directly from `@reown/appkit-react-native`. 


### `<AppKitButton />`

The `AppKitButton` is a versatile component that intelligently adapts its appearance and behavior based on the current connection status. 
- When no wallet is connected, it functions as a "Connect Wallet" button.
- When a wallet is connected, it functions as an "Account" button, typically displaying account information and a disconnect option.
