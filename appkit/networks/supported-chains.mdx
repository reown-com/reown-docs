## Natively Supported Chains

| Chain | Platforms |
|---|---|
| **EVM** (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.) | React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, Svelte, Nuxt, React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS, Unity |
| **Solana** | React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native |

### EVM Chains

AppKit supports all EVM-compatible chains. As long as the chain is included in [Viem's chain definitions](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/src/chains/index.ts), AppKit will support it. This includes Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and many more.
