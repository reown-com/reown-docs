Reown AppKit provides native SDK support for a specific set of blockchain networks. This page lists the chains you can integrate directly using the AppKit SDK.

<Note>
Looking for the full list of chains supported by the WalletConnect protocol? See the [WalletConnect Cloud Supported Chains](/cloud/chains/chain-list) page.

## Natively Supported Chains

| Chain | Support Level | Platforms |
|---|---|---|
| **EVM** (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.) | Full | React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, Svelte, Nuxt, React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS, Unity |
| **Solana** | Full | React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native |
| **Bitcoin** | Full | React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native |
| **Polkadot** | Flutter only | Flutter |

### EVM Chains

AppKit supports all EVM-compatible chains. As long as the chain is included in [Viem's chain definitions](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/src/chains/index.ts), AppKit will support it. This includes Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and many more.

### Polkadot

AppKit supports Polkadot on Flutter. For Polkadot integration details on other platforms, refer to the [Polkadot integration guide](/advanced/multichain/polkadot/dapp-integration-guide).

## Other Chains via WalletConnect Protocol

Chains not listed above can still work with WalletConnect at the protocol level for dApp-wallet communication. The [WalletConnect Cloud Supported Chains](/cloud/chains/chain-list) page lists all chains available through the protocol, including Cosmos, Sui, Stacks, Tron, Near, Stellar, and more.

For RPC method references on these chains, see the [Multi-Chain RPC Reference](/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/ethereum-rpc).
