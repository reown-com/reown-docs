## Support for all EVM Chains

The AppKit SDK supports all EVM-compatible chains, allowing users to connect their EVM wallets to Web3 applications. As long as the EVM chain you are trying to configure is included in [Viem's package](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/src/chains/index.ts), AppKit will support it.
