title: Explorer Submission

<Note>

Submitting a project to the Reown Cloud Explorer is recommended but optional. You can still use Reown services without submitting your project.
However, doing so ensures that your project is listed under [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/?utm_source=walletconnect-docs&utm_medium=cloud&utm_campaign=github) and [Cloud Explorer API](./explorer.md).

</Note>

## Creating a New Project

- Head over to [dashboard.reown.com](https://dashboard.reown.com/) and create a new project by clicking the "New Project" button in top right corner of the dashboard.
- Give a suitable name to your project, select whether its an App or Wallet and click the "Create" button. (You can change this later)

## How do we test wallets?

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:
