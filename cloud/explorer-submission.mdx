title: WalletGuide Submission
---

<Note>

Submitting a project to the Reown Dashboard Explorer is recommended but optional. You can still use Reown services without submitting your project.
However, doing so ensures that your project is listed under [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/?utm_source=walletconnect-docs&utm_medium=cloud&utm_campaign=github) and [Cloud Explorer API](./explorer.md).

</Note>

## Creating a New Project

First, open the Reown Dashboard by navigating to [dashboard.reown.com](https://dashboard.reown.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=devrel&utm_campaign=conversion) and signing in. If you don’t have an account yet, please create one before proceeding.

- Once you're logged in, go to the "**Projects**" section under **Cloud** and click on "**+ Project**".

## How do we test wallets?

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:
