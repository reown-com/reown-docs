## How it works

Our SIWX API implements the [Sign In With X (SIWX)](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-122) standard - a chain-agnostic evolution of [Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361).

1. Users sign a cryptographic message with their wallet
2. Message signature is securely forwarded to our verification servers
3. Upon successful validation, a JWT token is issued for your application
4. Seamless integration with your existing authentication flows
