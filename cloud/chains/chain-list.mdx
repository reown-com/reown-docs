import { ChainList } from "/snippets/chainlist.mdx"

<Note>
This list shows chains supported at the **WalletConnect Cloud and protocol level**. Being listed here means a chain can use the WalletConnect protocol for dApp-wallet communication, but it does **not** mean every chain is natively supported in Reown AppKit.

For chains with native Reown AppKit SDK support (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, TON, and Polkadot), see the [Reown AppKit Supported Chains](/appkit/networks/supported-chains) page.
