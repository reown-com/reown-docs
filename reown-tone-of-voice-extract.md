## The Voice

Reown's voice is the embodiment of its mission, vision, and personality — the way it communicates across all platforms.

Here's how Reown sounds:

### 1. Visionary and Inspirational

*What this means:*

- Position Reown as a movement toward a better, open, permissionless onchain future.
- Messaging should excite and inspire, making people feel part of something bigger.
- Lead with big-picture transformation—how Reown removes friction, enhances security, and makes onchain UX intuitive.
- Avoid using messaging that excludes product managers, UX designers, businesses, and general onchain users.
- Avoid overly functional or robotic descriptions (e.g., "Reown provides a suite of onchain authentication services").

**Sounds like:**
"Onchain UX isn't broken—it's just waiting to be reimagined. We're here to make that happen."

**Doesn't sound like:**
"Reown is an API provider for onchain authentication and transactions."

### 2. Clear and Accessible

*What this means:*

- Keep messaging clear, digestible, and inclusive for developers, product owners, and everyday users alike.
- Explain tech through its impact, not just mechanics.
- Frame features in a way that anyone can understand (e.g., "Let users sign in however they want" instead of "Multi-provider authentication flow").
- Avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Don't over-explain technical features without tying them to benefits.

**Sounds like:**
"Sign in with a wallet, email, or social login. However users prefer. No confusion, no barriers."

**Doesn't sound like:**
"Reown enables multi-provider authentication via OAuth, MPC, and Web3-native key management solutions."

### 3. Confident, but Approachable

*What this means:*

- Reown is open, inclusive, and welcoming.
- The tone is assertive but not arrogant—a trusted guide, not a know-it-all.
- Use straightforward, confident language that speaks directly to users.
- Avoid formal, stiff language that makes Reown feel impersonal.
- Avoid overused buzzwords that don't add meaning (e.g., "Revolutionary solutions for onchain excellence").
- Reown does not have a hero or savior complex. It puts the spotlight on the builders and the users of the onchain internet.

**Sounds like:**
"We make building onchain experiences simple. No learning curve, just great UX."

**Doesn't sound like:**
"Our proprietary technology is the only viable solution for Web3 user authentication."

### 4. Empowering and Collaborative

*What this means:*

- The language should make builders feel capable and supported, and part of a community. Not overwhelmed or like they're reporting to a final boss.

**Sounds like:**
"Your vision, our battle-tested infrastructure. Let's make onchain effortless—together."

**Doesn't sound like:**
"Our tools are designed for enterprises and developers seeking Web3 integrations."

### 5. Transparent and Trustworthy

*What this means:*

- Security, ownership, and decentralization are core to Reown — but they should never feel intimidating.
- Reown explains risks clearly but without fear-mongering.

**Sounds like:**
"Users shouldn't have to guess what they're signing. With Reown, they won't."

**What Reown shouldn't sound like:**

- Too corporate or bureaucratic. No stuffy, overly formal language.
- Too technical or exclusive. No excessive jargon that alienates non-developers. The exception to this is content aimed directly at developers, like developer docs, Reddit content, technical blogs, to name a few.
- Too vague or buzzword-heavy. No empty claims — always explain how Reown creates real impact.
- Too fear-based. No messaging that makes Web3 sound unsafe or inaccessible.

## The Tone

If the voice is Reown's personality, then the tone is all the different ways Reown expresses that personality. Tone is a powerful tool that can both shape a positive user experience for people and clear the air in a negative one. Tone of voice is the way we tell our audience how *we* feel about our message, and it will influence how *they'll* feel about our message, too.

### Tone Spectrum

- **Funny — Serious**: **+2 Serious** — You are not dry or boring, but you avoid humor and playfulness. You want to be taken seriously because trust is core to your tone.
- **Casual — Formal**: **+2 towards Formal** — Professional and trustworthy, but with a conversational edge. Not stiff, but definitely leaning formal.
- **Irreverent — Respectful**: **+1 Respectful** — You're not edgy or irreverent; you value trust and professionalism, and you keep communication respectful.
- **Enthusiastic — Matter of Fact**: **+2 Enthusiastic** — You're passionate and sympathetic. While you avoid sounding overly playful or sparky, you still want to convey warmth and genuine energy.

### How Reown Sounds Across Channels

#### 1. Social Media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

*Goal: Professional, human, informative, warm. Build trust, show passion for the mission.*

**Example:**
> Reown's SDKs are the gateway to the WalletConnect Network—giving you access to millions of users, thousands of apps, and billions in onchain value.

**What to avoid:**
- "The future is lit! 🔥 Jump in for wild rewards!" (too playful/sparky)
- "Boring? Maybe. Reliable? Absolutely." (too sarcastic/dry)

#### 2. Customer Support / Help Center

*Goal: Sympathetic, clear, professional, and reassuring. Trust first.*

**Example:**
> We understand how important it is to solve x issue. Here's how you can resolve this step by step. If you need help along the way, we're here for you.

> Thanks for reaching out! Let's work through this together. Could you please share a bit more detail about the issue you're facing? We'll guide you from there.

**What to avoid:**
- "Oops! Something went wrong" (too playful)
- "Well, that's awkward." (too irreverent)

#### 3. Developer Documentation

*Goal: Informative, professional, straightforward, helpful and respectful of developers' time.*

**Example:**
> The Reown SDK allows you to integrate wallet recovery and ownership tracking seamlessly across multiple chains. Follow the steps below to get started, or refer to our API reference for advanced use cases.

> Important: Ensure you've configured your environment variables correctly before initializing the SDK. Incorrect setup may result in failed transactions.

It's okay to use language and phrasing that's technical.

**What to avoid:**
- "Heads up, devs! Time to get your hands dirty." (too casual/playful)

#### 4. Website / Product Pages

*Goal: Professional, informative, and trustworthy, but still engaging.*

**Example:**
> Build your wallet into a gateway to onchain apps. Integrate, launch, and scale feature-rich onchain apps — fast.

**What to avoid:**
- "Plug in and let the magic happen ✨" (too playful)
- "We're obsessed with chains and you should be too!" (too edgy/sparky)
