            This is the official documentation portal for Reown (formerly WalletConnect), built with Mintlify.

            Architecture and Stack:
            - Static documentation site using Mintlify framework rendering MDX files
            - Package manager: pnpm
            - Spell checking via cspell on all .md and .mdx files
            - Analytics integrations: PostHog and Google Tag Manager
            - Central configuration in docs.json controlling navigation, theme (Aspen), redirects, and integrations

            Content Structure:
            - appkit/ - Primary SDK documentation covering 11 platforms: React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, Svelte, Nuxt, React Native, Flutter, iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin), Unity (C#)
            - cloud/ - Cloud services docs: Relay (WebSocket), Blockchain API (RPC), Analytics, Explorer/WalletGuide
            - advanced/ - Multichain RPC references (Sui, Stacks, Bitcoin), providers, security
            - snippets/ - Reusable code examples shared across platform docs
            - images/ - Static assets (icons, demos, screenshots)

            Key Patterns and Conventions:
            - Each platform SDK follows a consistent structure: core/installation, core/options, core/hooks or core/actions, core/components, core/theming
            - MDX files use Mintlify components (Cards, Tabs, CodeGroups, Accordions)
            - Code examples demonstrate createAppKit() initialization with projectId, metadata, networks, and adapters
            - Redirects maintain backward compatibility from legacy WalletConnect/Web3Modal paths to current Reown paths

            Domain-Specific Knowledge:
            - Multichain Web3 infrastructure supporting EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, Sui, TON, and Stacks networks
            - CAIP-2 chain identifiers (e.g., eip155:1 for Ethereum mainnet)
            - Authentication patterns: SIWE (Sign In With Ethereum), SIWX (multi-chain), One-Click Auth, social logins
            - Payment features: Pay with Exchange (PWE), Deposit with Exchange (DWE), One-Click Checkout
            - Chain abstraction for cross-chain transaction orchestration

            Review Focus:
            - Accuracy of code examples and SDK usage patterns
            - Correct MDX syntax and Mintlify component usage
            - Consistency across platform-specific documentation
            - Valid links and redirect configurations in docs.json
            - Proper spelling (cspell is enforced)
