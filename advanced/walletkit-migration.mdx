## WalletConnect Dashboard FAQ

If you are a legacy WalletKit team previously using the Reown Cloud dashboard, the new [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) is now the place to manage all your wallet projects, integrations, and WalletGuide submissions. Below are answers to common questions about the transition.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where should WalletKit teams manage their projects now?">
    All WalletKit teams should use the new [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) to manage their projects. This dashboard replaces the Reown Cloud dashboard as the unified hub for wallet and app developers to create projects, submit wallets to WalletGuide, and manage WalletConnect Certification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my existing Project ID still work?">
    Yes. Your existing Project ID will remain the same and will continue to work as expected. There is no need to create a new Project ID or update your integration. Simply log in to [dashboard.walletconnect.com](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) and you will find your existing projects and Project IDs ready to use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my team setup carry over to the new dashboard?">
    Yes. Your team setup, including team members and project configurations, will remain the same on the new WalletConnect Dashboard. No action is required to migrate your team — everything carries over automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I log in to the new WalletConnect Dashboard?">
    You can log in to [dashboard.walletconnect.com](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) using the same credentials you used for the Reown Cloud dashboard. Your login method (email, social, or wallet-based authentication) remains unchanged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can I do on the new WalletConnect Dashboard?">
    The [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) is the unified home for wallet and app developers. From the dashboard you can:

    - **Create and manage projects** — Set up new projects and obtain Project IDs for your wallet or app.
    - **Submit your wallet to WalletGuide** — Get your wallet listed in the WalletConnect modal so users can discover and connect with it.
    - **Manage WalletConnect Certification** — Submit, track, and manage your certification process all in one place.
    - **View analytics** — Monitor usage and performance of your integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to update any code or configuration?">
    No code changes are required. Your existing Project IDs and SDK integrations will continue to work without modification. The dashboard change only affects where you manage your projects and settings — it does not impact your application's runtime behavior.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I learn more about the new dashboard?">
